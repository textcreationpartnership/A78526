            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y this Gentleman your Majeſties Lieutenant, I underſtand of ſome halt you made, and the Cauſe of it, at ſuch time as he offered to your Majeſtie my Letters. But ſoon after, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie could reſolve your ſelf and behold me nothing ſo diffident of you, but in humble language petitioning your favour; for I am in hope, that my condition is not capable of ſo much more miſery, as that I need to make my ſelf a paſſage to you by ſuch way of interceſſion. This which followes after, I offer your Majeſting though not as to your ſelf, for upon leſſe motive you can find favour for me: Now I need onely move, not plead, before your Majeſtie, as my Caſe doth ſtand, for what I ſeek to have done, followes upon what you have already done, as a Conſequence and ſucceeding growth of your own act. But to the effect, that your Majeſtie may ſee that there is enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe (if any ſuch there be) as do go about to pervert the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of your Power, and to turn it from its own clear excellency, for to miniſter unto their paſſions: I have preſumed to this end to awake your Majeſties own Concelpt upon this ſubject, which can gather to it ſelf better, and more able defences in my behalf upon this view; for though the acts of your mercy which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, nor the Cauſes of them with others, as derived from thoſe ſecret motives, which are only ſenſible and privie to your own heart, and admit of no ſearch or diſcovery to any general ſatisfaction, and that under this protection I might guard my particular ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet my Caſe needs not hide it ſelf, but attend the diſpute with any,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111544:20"/>that would put upon it a monſtrous and heavy ſhape. For though that I muſt acknowledge, that both life and eſtate are forfeit to you by Law, yet ſo forfeited, as the ſame Law gives you the ſame power to preſerve, as it doth to puniſh, whereby your Majeſties higher prerogative doth not wreſtle with it, nor do you infringe thoſe grounds by which you have ever governed; ſo as the reſiſtance is not great that your Majeſtie hath, for to give life, and which is leſſe, in the gift of eſtate, for that the Law caſts wholly upon your ſelf, and yields it as fit matter for the exerciſe of your goodneſſe. Once it was your Majeſties guift to me, ſo it may be better not taken then a ſecond time given; for it is common to all men for to avoid to take that which hath been once their own. And I may ſay farther, that Law hath not been ſo ſevere upon the ruine of innocent poſterity, nor yet Cancelled, nor cut off the merits of Anceſtors, before the politique hand of State had contrived it into thoſe ſeveral forms, as fitted to their ends and government. To this I may adde, that that whereupon I was judged, even the Crime it ſelf might have been none, if your Majeſties hand had not once touched upon it, by which all acceſſe unto your favour was quite taken from me. Yet as it did at length appear, I fell, rather for want of well defending, then by the violence or force of any proofes: for I ſo far forſook my ſelf, and my Cauſe, as that it may be a queſtion whether I was more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for that, or for the matter it ſelf which was the ſubject of that dayes Controverſie. Then thus far nothing hath appeared, wherein your Majeſtie hath extended for me your power beyond the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bound, neither doth any thing ſtand ſo in the way of your future proceedings, but rather make eaſie the acceſſe of your Majeſties fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to my relief.</p>
               <p>What may then be the cauſe, that Malice can pitch upon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Majeſtie ſhould not proceed for to accompliſh your own work? Aſperſions are taken away by your Majeſties letting me become ſubject to the utmoſt power of Law, with the lives of ſo many of the offendours, which yieldeth the world ſubject of ſorrow rather then appetite to more bloud, but truth and innocency protect themſelves in poor men, much more in Kings. Neither ever was there ſuch aſperſion (God knowes) in any poſſibility towards your Majeſtie, but amongſt thoſe who would create thoſe pretences to miſlead your Majeſtie, and thereby make me miſerable. If not this (whereof the virtue, and uſe, was in the former time and now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined) there is not any but your pleaſure. It is true, I am forfeited to your Majeſtie, but not againſt you by any treaſonable or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111544:20"/>act. Beſides, there is to be yielded a diſtinction of men as in faults; in which I am of both under the neereſt degrees of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet your Majeſtie hath pardoned life and eſtate to Traytors, and to ſtrangers, ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other; Nay to ſome concerned in this buſineſſe wherein I ſuffer, you have pardoned more unto, then I deſire; who as (it is reported) if they had come to the teſt, had proved Copper, and ſhould have drunk of the bitter Cup as well as others. But I do not by this envy your favours to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor ſeek I to draw them in the yoak with my ſelf, but applaud your Majeſties goodneſſe,

                  </note> being in that reſpect in a neerer poſſibility to come at me. Beſides this, to <hi>Elviſh</hi> your Majeſtie hath given eſtate, which is a greater gift then life, becauſe it extends to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who was the worſt deſerver in this buſineſs; an unoffended inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might have prevented all after-miſchief, who for his own ends ſuffered it, and by the like arts afterwards bewrayed it. To this I may adde <hi>Treſham</hi> in the Powder Treaſon,
<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Lewis Treſham.</hi>
                  </note> upon whoſe ſucceſſours I do not caſt any of his infamy, yet he preſerved himſelf to poſterity, ſo as what he, or others ſuch as he, have defrauded by the arts of Law, and whom their own unfaithfulneſſe made ſafe, I have much adoe to hold by ingenuity, and Confidence. How may it be that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I diſtruſted not your Majeſtie, or becauſe it returned in your power from whom I had it, it is in danger to be broken or diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. Let me hope that there is nothing which by favour may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, or by induſtry might have been avoided, that will fail me, where your Majeſtie is to determine. It is not I who thus put your Majeſtie in mind importunely: It is he that was your Creature, it is <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> with all your honours, and envious greatneſſe, that is now in queſtion. Kings themſelves are protected from the breach of Law by being Favorites and Gods anointed, which gives your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie the like priviledge over yours;
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Dunne.</hi>
                  </note> As I took from Dr. <hi>Dunne</hi> in his Sermon, that the goodneſſe of God is not ſo much acknowledged by us in being our Creator, as in being our Redeemer; nor in that he hath choſen us, as that nothing can take us out of his hands, which in your Majeſties remembrance let me challenge, and hope for: For the firſt acceſſes of favour, they may be aſcribed to ones own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves, but that appears to be for our ſakes and for our good, when the ſame forſakes not our civil deſerts. This redemption I crave, not as to my own perſon, but with your benefits once given; nor do I aſſume them very deep, for I have voluntarily departed from the hopes of perſion, place, office; I only cleave to that which is ſo little, as that it will ſuffer no pairing, or diminution.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111544:21"/>
               <p>And as in my former Letters, ſo by this I humbly crave of your Majeſtie not to let the practiſes of Court work upon your Son the Prince, not fearing your ſufferance of my loſſe in that particular ſo much, (for I cannot loſe it, but willingly all with it) as for to take off the Stage, that which in the attempt may prove inconvenient. And conſider I pray your Majeſtie, that my hope in deſiring to paſſe theſe had times, was to be reſtored to my fortunes; others are made unhappy by me, if otherwiſe, and then I loſe my end. I ſpeak of impairing, of changing, or ſupplying, as of any other way, all ſuch alterations, and ruine, are alike, without I be worthy of your gift, and that I can be worthy of all, that Law can permit you to give, or caſt upon your Majeſtie by a more neerer title, as it doth by this; I ſhall account them equal evils, that leave nothing, or a patched and proportioned one, changed or tranſlated from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But if your Majeſtie have any reſpects to move you to ſuſpend your good towards me; let that which is mine reſt in your own hands, till that you find all oppoſite humours conformed to your purpoſe. I have done wrong to my ſelf, thus to entertain ſuch a doubt of your Majeſty; but the unrelenting of adverſaries, which when you will have them, will ſooner alter; and that all this while I have received nothing of preſent notice for direction, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me, from your Majeſty, hath made me to expoſtulate with my ſelf thus hardly. For God is my judge Sir, I can never be worthy to be; if I have theſe markes put upon me of a Traytor, as that tumbling and diſordering of that eſtate would declare the divorce from your preſence, laies too much upon me, and this would upon both.</p>
               <p>I will ſay no farther, neither in that which your Majeſty doubted my aptneſſe to fall into, for my Cauſe, nor my Confidence is not in that diſtreſſe as for to uſe that mean of interceſſion, nor of any thing beſides, but to remember your Majeſtie, that I am the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of your hands, and bear your ſtamp deeply imprinted in all the characters of favour; that I was the firſt plant ingrafted by your Majeſties hand in this place, therefore not to be unrooted by the ſame hand, leſt it ſhould taint all the ſame kind, with the touch of that fatalneſſe; And that I was even the Son of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe ſervices are regiſtred in the firſt honours and impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I took of your Majeſties favour, and laid there as a foundation ſtone of that building; Theſe and your Majeſties goodneſſe for to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111544:21"/>receive them, is that I rely upon. So praying for your Majeſties proſperity, I am in all humbleneſſe</p>

               <p>I ſhall humbly crave at your Lordſhips hands a benigne interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which I ſhall now write; for words that come from waſted ſpirits, and an oppreſſed mind, are more ſafe in being depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a noble Conſtruction, then in being Circled with any reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Caution. Having made this as a protection to all, which I ſhall ſay, I will go on, but with a very ſtrange entrance (as may ſeem to your Lordſhips at the firſt) for in the midſt of a ſtate of as great affliction, as I think a mortal man can endure, (honour being above life) I ſhall begin with the profeſſing gladneſſe in ſome things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that hereafter the greatneſſe of a Judge or Magiſtrates, ſhall be no Sanctuary, or protection to him againſt guiltineſſe, which in few words is the beginning of a golden world.</p>
               <p>The next, that after this example, it is like that Judges will flie from any thing in the likeneſſe of Corruption (though it were at a great diſtance) as from a Serpent, which tendeth to the purging of the Courts of Juſtice, and reducing them to their true honour and ſplendour. And in theſe two points God is my witneſſe (though it be my fortune to be the anvile upon which theſe good effects are beaten and wrought) I take no ſmall comfort. But to paſſe from the motions of my heart, whereof God is onely Judge, to the merits of my Cauſe, whereof your Lordſhips are onely Judges, under God, and his Lievtenant; I do underſtand, there hath been expected from me heretofore ſome juſtification, and therefore I have choſen one onely juſtification inſtead of all others, out of the juſtification of <hi>Job,</hi> for after the clear ſubmiſſion and Confeſſion, which I ſhall now make unto your Lordſhips, I hope I may ſay, and juſtifie with <hi>Job</hi> in theſe words, <hi>I have not hid my ſin as did Adam, nor concealed my faults in my boſome.</hi> This is the only juſtification I will uſe. It reſteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111544:22"/>that without fig-leaves, I do ingenuouſly confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that having underſtood the particulars of the charge, not formally from the houſe, but enough to inform my Conſcience and memory, I find matter both ſufficient and full, to move me to deſert the defence, and to move your Lordſhips to condemn and cenſure me. Neither will I trouble your Lordſhips by ſingling out particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which I think may fall off. <hi>Quid te exempta juvat ſpinis de millibus una?</hi> Neither will I prompt your Lordſhips to obſerve upon the proofes, where they come not home, or the ſcruples touching the Credit of the Witneſſes: Neither will I preſent unto your Lordſhips, how far a defence might in divers things extenuate the offence, in reſpect of the time, or manner of the gift, or the like circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but onely leave theſe things to ſpring out of your own noble thoughts, and obſervations of the evidence, and examinations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and charitably to wind about the particulars of the charge here and there, as God ſhall put in your minds, and ſo ſubmit my ſelf wholly to your piety and grace.</p>
               <p>And now that I have ſpoken to your Lordſhips, as Judges, I ſhall ſay a few words unto you, as Peers, and Prelates, humbly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Cauſe to your noble Minds, and magnanimous affections.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhips are not onely Judges, but Parliamentary Judges, you have a farther extent of arbitrary power, then other Courts: and if you be not tied to the ordinary courſe of Courts, or preſidents, in point of ſtrictneſſe and ſeverity, much more in points of mercy and mitigation. And yet if any thing I ſhould move might be contrary to your honourable and worthy ends to introduce a reformation, I ſhould not ſeek it. But herein I beſeech your Lordſhips to give me leave to tell you a ſtory. <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> took his ſons life for giving battail againſt the prohibition of his General. Not many years after the like ſeverity was purſued by <hi>Papirius Curſor</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator againſt <hi>Quintus Maximus,</hi> who being upon the point to be ſentenced, was by the interceſſion of ſome principal perſons of the Senate ſpared; whereupon <hi>Livie</hi> maketh this grave and gracious obſervation, <hi>Neque minus firmata eſt diſciplina militaris periculo Quinti Maximi, quam mirabili ſupplicio Titi Manlii,</hi> The diſcipline of War was no leſſe eſtabliſhed by the queſtioning onely of <hi>Quintus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi> then by the puniſhment of <hi>Titus Manlius.</hi> And the ſame reaſon is of the reformation of Juſtice; for the queſtioning of men of eminent place hath the ſame terrour, though not the ſame rigour with the puniſhment. But my Caſe ſtayeth not there, for my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſire is, that his Majeſtie would take the Seal into his hands,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111544:22"/>which is a great downfal, and may ſerve I hope in it ſelf for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of my faults.</p>
               <p>Therefore if mercy and mitigation be in your Lordſhips power, and do no wayes croſſe your ends, why ſhould I not hope of your favours and Commiſerations? Your Lordſhips may be pleaſed to behold your chief Pattern the King our Soveraign, a King of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Clemencie, and whoſe heart is inſtructable for wiſdom and goodneſſe. You well remember, that there ſate not theſe hundred years before in your Houſe a Prince (and never ſuch a Prince) whoſe preſence deſerveth to be made memorable by records, and acts, mixt of mercy and juſtice. Your ſelves are either Nobles (and Compaſſion ever beateth in the veins of noble bloud,) or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelates, who are the ſervants of him, that would <hi>not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench ſmoaking flaxe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You all ſit upon a high Stage, and therefore cannot but be more fenſible of the changes of humane Condition, and of the fall of any from high places. Neither will your Lordſhips forget that there are <hi>vitia tomporis,</hi> as well as <hi>vitia hominis,</hi> and that the beginning of reformation, hath a contrary power to the pool of <hi>Betheſda;</hi> for that had ſtrength onely to cure him, that was firſt caſt in, and this hath ſtrength to hurt him onely, that is firſt Caſt in; and for my part, I wiſh it may ſtay there, and go no further.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I aſſure my ſelf, your Lordſhips have a noble feeling of me, as a member of your own body; and one, that in this very Seſſion, had ſome taſte of your loving affection, which I hope was not a lightning before the death of them, but rather a ſpark of that grace which now in the Concluſion will more appear. And therefore my humble ſuit to your Lordſhips is, that my voluntary Confeſſion be my ſentence, and the loſſe of the Seal my puniſhment, and that your Lordſhips will ſpare any farther ſentence, but recommend me to his Majeſties grace and pardon for all that is paſt. And ſo, &amp;c.</p>

Surely the opinion I have ever had of my Lord (whereof your Majeſtie is beſt witneſſe) is far from that: But my meaning was plain and ſimple; that his Lordſhip might through his great fortune, be the leſſe apt to Caſt, and foreſee, the unfaithfulneſſe of friends, and the malignity of enemies, and accidents of times.

               <p>At my firſt arrival into this your happy Kingdome, I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the general relation of all that had recourſe unto me, that one here (who had the title of Ambaſſadour from my Maſter) did

But the caution that I ought to have of my own juſtification, when I return home, biddeth me the more ſtrictly to examine the truth of that which was told me (whereon my action with Sir <hi>Robert Shirley</hi> was grounded) and to have it averred in the particulars, as well as by a general voice. Therefore I humbly beſeech your Majeſtie, that out of your Princely goodneſſe you will be pleaſed to give ſuch order, that this point may be fully cleared. Wherein for the manner of proceeding, I wholly and humbly remit my ſelf to your Majeſtie: And this being done, I ſhall return home with ſome meaſure of joy to ballance the grief which I have, for having done ought, that may have clouded your Majeſties favour to me.

               <p>Your Majeſtie hath propounded a Toleration of Religion, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to take into your Conſideration, what your Act is, and what the Conſequence may be.

               <p>Beſides, this Tolleration you endeavour to ſet up by your Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it cannot be done without a Parliament, unleſſe your Majeſtie will let your Subjects ſee, that you now take unto your ſelf a libertie to throw down the Lawes of the Land at your pleaſure.

               <p>The Prince's coming hither ſeemed not ſo ſtrange, as acceptable, and pleaſing unto all. The Common ſort expreſſed it by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſhouts, and acclamations of joy, offering, and marrying the <hi>Infanta</hi> (as it were) preſently, by publique voice, as having wonne and truly deſerved her, by ſo brave an adventure. The King and State ſtudied how to do him all the honour that might be: The firſt decree that the Councel of State made, was, that at all occaſions of meetings, he ſhould have the precedencie of the King. That he ſhould make entrie into the Palace in the form of State, as the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> do in the firſt day of their Coronation. That he ſhould have one of the chief Quarters of the Kings Houſe for his lodgings, one hundred of the Guard to attend him, all the Councel to obey him, as the Kings own perſon. All priſoners were releaſed, the new
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111544:26"/>Proclamation againſt exceſſe in apparel revoked, and ſundry other arguments of joy. But a wonder laſteth not but for nine daies.</p>
               <p>This univerſal joy was grounded upon hopes, that the Prince came not onely to fetch a wife, but alſo to make himſelf a <hi>Catholique.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Say you ſo?</note> The Pope incited him hereunto by Letters, which his Nuntio delivered. He ſent a charge to the inquiſitor general, to uſe all poſſible diligence herein. Many proceſſions, and ſhewes were made to ſtirre him. But they ſoon ſaw how <hi>improbable</hi> it was to win him,
<note place="margin">For which God be thanked.</note> how amongſt all his ſervants there was not one Catholique about him: what ſlight eſteem they made of the Churches, and Religion here; ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting irreverent, and ſcandalous actions in the Kings own Chappel, ſo that they began to behold the Engliſh with an ill aſpect, to inveigh againſt the <hi>Conde de Gundomar,</hi> that he ſhould inform the King and State, that the Prince had a diſpoſition eaſie to be wrought upon to be made a Catholique. Adde hereunto the ill offices that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do, who to preſerve themſelves in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> penſion did prejudice the buſineſſe, by caſting aſperſions upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the mis-information of the perſecution in their Country, and in <hi>England</hi> notwithſtanding being here, and the abuſe of the Ambaſſadours ſervants in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Prince came, there wanted nothing for the final conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all things but the diſpenſation, which came two moneths after. And whereas it was expected to come abſolute, and full; it came infringed with Cautions and limitations, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Infanta</hi> ſhould not be married till matters in <hi>England</hi> were in perfect execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that in caſe the King of <hi>England</hi> could not give ſufficient ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf ſhould ſwear, and undertake the oath for him. Hereupon a <hi>Junto</hi> of Divines was appointed to determine hereof, Whether the King might do this with a ſafe Conſcience or no. Theſe Divines went gravely and tediouſly to work; which put the Prince upon that impatiency, that he was upon point of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When at laſt the buſineſſe came to a reſolution, and ſo the Match was publiquely declared. The Prince had then often (though publiquely) acceſſe to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> the King being ſtill himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and in hearing. After this a Ratification was ſent for from <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Pope dying in the interim, and the new Pope falling ſuddenly ſick, it could not be ſpeedily procured. For want of this Ratification there was no Contract made, and the Prince himſelf ſeemed not to deſire it. A little before his departure, the King and the Councel of State, with the Patriarch of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Prince-Prelate, after the Biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> (who is under age) ſwore to all the Capitulations, ſo that the Prince ſeemed to depart well ſatisfied.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111544:27"/>The King brought him to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> and a little before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the King and he went into a cloſe Coach, and had a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe together, (my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> being in another Coach hard by to interpret ſome hard words, when he was called.) And ſo they parted with many tender demonſtrations of love. A Trophy of Marble is erected in the place where they parted. Many rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents were given on both ſides. The Prince beſtowed upon the Queen the biggeſt Crown Pearl in the world between two Diamonds. He gave the <hi>Infanta</hi> a rope of Pearl, and an anchor of great Diamonds, with many other Jewels. He hath been very bountiful to every one of the Kings houſe, and all the Guard. Never Prince parted with ſuch an univerſal love of all. He left every mouth filled with his Commendations; every one reporting him to be a truly Noble, diſcreet, and well deſerving Prince. I write what I hear, and know, and that without paſſion, for all he is the Prince of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> at firſt, was much eſteemed, but it laſted little; his <hi>French</hi> garb, with his ſtout haſtineſſe in negotiating, and over-familiarity with the Prince, was not liked. Moreover, the Councel of <hi>Spain</hi> took it ill, that a green head, ſhould come with ſuch a ſuperintendent power to treat of an affair of ſuch Conſequence, among ſo many grave Miniſters of State, to the prejudice of ſo able and well-deſerving a Miniſter as my Lord of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who laid the firſt ſtone of this building. Hereupon his power was called in queſtion, and found imperfect in regard it was not confirmed by the Councel. Thus the buſineſſe began to gather ill bloud between <hi>Olivarez,</hi> and him, and grew ſo far out of ſquare, that unleſſe there had been good heads to peece them together again, all might have fallen quite off the hinges. He did not take his leave of the Counteſſe of <hi>Olivarez,</hi> and the farewel he took of the <hi>Conde</hi> himſelf was harſh; for he told him, he would be an everlaſting ſervant to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Queen, and the Infants, and would endeavour to do the beſt offices he could, for the concluding of this buſineſſe, and ſtrengthening the amity between the two Kingdomes; but for himſelf, he had ſo far disobliged him, that he could make no profeſſion of friendſhip to him at all. The <hi>Conde</hi> turned about, and ſaid he accepted of what he had ſpoken, and ſo parted.</p>
               <p>Since his Highneſſe departure, my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> negotiates cloſely, he is daily at the Palace to attend the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and he treats by means of the Counteſſe of <hi>Olivarez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a new <hi>Junto</hi> appointed for the diſpoſing of the Infanta's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111544:27"/>affairs, and we hope here, that all things will be ripe againſt the next Spring to bring her over. And ſo I reſt, &amp;c.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Received a Letter from your Lordſhip dated the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this month, written in anſwer to a former, which I directed to your Lordſhip by his Majeſties Commandment. This laſt Letter (according to my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) I have ſhewed unto his Majeſtie; who hath peruſed it, and hath commanded me to write back this unto you again. That he finds himſelf nothing ſatisfied therewith; the queſtion propounded to your Lordſhip from his Majeſtie was plain and clear, Whether you did rather chooſe to ſit ſtill without being queſtion'd for any errours paſt in your negotiation in Spain, and enjoy the benefit of the late gratious pardon granted in Parliament, whereof you may have the benefit; or whether for the clearing of your innocency (whereof your ſelf, your friends, and your followers are ſo confident) you will be contented to wave the advantage of that pardon, and put your ſelf into a legal way of examination for the tryal thereof? His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties purpoſe hereby is not to prevent you of any favours the Law hath given: but if your aſſurance be ſuch as your words and letter import, he conceiveth it ſtands not with that publique and reſolute profeſſion of your integrity, to decline your tryal. His Majeſtie leaves the choyce to your ſelf, and requires from you a direct anſwer, without Circumlocution, or bargaining with him for future favours before hand.</p>
               <p>But if you have a deſire to make uſe of that pardon which cannot be denyed to you, nor is it any way deſired to be taken from you; His Majeſtie expects, that you ſhould at leaſt forbear to magnifie your ſervice, and out of the opinion of your own innocency caſt an aſperſion upon his Majeſties Juſtice, in not affording you that preſent fulneſſe of liberty and favour which cannot be drawn from him, but in his own good time, and according to his own good pleaſure. Thus much I have in command to write unto your Lordſhip, and to require your anſwer cleerly and plainly by this Meſſenger ſent on purpoſe for it. And ſo, &amp;c.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Received your Letter of the 25. of <hi>February,</hi> and therein a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment from his Majeſtie, and in his Majeſties name to make a cleer and plain anſwer, Whether I deſire or reſt in the ſecurity I am now in, and to acknowledge the gratious favour of his late Majeſtie, and of his which now is, who have been pleaſed not to queſtion my actions, &amp;c. Hereunto I have laboured exactly to obey, but find that a plain and clear anſwer cannot poſſibly be made, untill there be a cleer underſtanding of the thing propounded; ſo that I may crave pardon if my anſwer be not ſo cleer as I could wiſh it: for I muſt freely acknowledge, that I no way underſtand what is meant by the ſecurity I am now in, whether it be by the preſent eſtate I am now in, or not: If it be ſo, I conceive a man cannot be under a harder Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for your Lordſhip knoweth, that by order my perſon is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and you were pleaſed lately to ſend me word, that you would not adviſe me to make uſe of the liberty which his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie had given me of coming to <hi>London,</hi> although that were onely to follow my private affairs, and for the recovery of my decayed health. I ſtand likewiſe problbited to come to the Court, or to the Kings preſence, (I paſſe by my being removed from all my places, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and wholly depending upon his Majeſties royal pleaſure.) But being a Peer of this Realm, I have not onely by Commandment, been formerly ſtayed from the Parliament, but of late, my writ hath been detained, as though my honour were forfeited. And this is truly the Condition I am now in, but I cannot imagine that this is the ſecurity intended I ſhould reſt in; but am in hope, that the ſecurity intended is, that I may for the future enjoy the liberty of a free Subject, and the priviledges of a Peer of the Kingdom. Which being ſo, I ſhall with all humility acknowledge his Majeſties grace and favour, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſerve him with all fidelity even to the laying down of my life, not thinking it to ſtand with the duty of a Subject to preſſe his being queſtioned, ſince ſuch being the pleaſure of his Soveraign, it were not in the power of any ſubject to avoid it. But in caſe his Majeſtie ſhall be pleaſed to bring me to any legal tryal, I ſhall moſt willingly and dutifully ſubmit my ſelf thereunto, and doubt not but my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in the end will be my beſt Mediatour for his Majeſties future favour. And in that Caſe I am a ſuitor that my Writ of Parliament as a Peer of this Realm may be ſent unto me, and that my preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:111544:29"/>to <hi>London</hi> may not diſpleaſe his Majeſtie; As for the pardon of the 21. <hi>Reg. Jacobi,</hi> which you mention, I ſhould renounce, but that I know that the juſteſt and moſt cautious man living, may through ignorance or omiſſion offend the Lawes, ſo that as a Subject I ſhall not diſclaim any benefit which cometh in the general as it doth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to all other Subjects in the Kingdom: But as for any Crime in particular, that may trench upon my imployments in point of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fidelity, or want of affection to the King or State, I know my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to be ſuch, that I am confident I ſhall not need that pardon. I ſhall conclude with a moſt humble ſuit unto your Lordſhip, that out of your nobleneſſe, and that friendſhip that hath been betwixt us, you will uſe your beſt endeavours both with his Majeſtie and the Duke, that this unfortunate buſineſſe may be paſt over, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing whereof I can ſee little uſe that can be made but the adding to a mans misfortunes already ſufficiently humbled; For I am ready to do all that a man of honour and honeſtie may do; but rather then to do any thing that may be prejudicial to me in that kind, to ſuffer whatſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to ſend. And ſo with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my humble ſervice unto your Lordſhip, I recommend you unto Gods holy protection, And reſt</p>

                  <salute>My very worthy Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Give you many thanks for your Letter of the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of <hi>July,</hi> by which I underſtand your great care of me, by ſeconding a former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it pleaſed your Lordſhip to make, of having me reconciled to my Lord Dukes favour, (A thing which I have infinitely deſired) and have eſteemed the good offices you have been pleaſed to do therein, as a very high obligation your Lordſhip puts upon me. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Lordſhip will find that any motion you have made in that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111544:29"/>kind unto his Grace hath been deſpiſed, rather then received with any thankfulneſſe, or that he hath returned you any anſwer of his inclination thereunto. For the truth is, my Lord doth look down upon my poor Condition with that ſcorn and contempt, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture the very moving of any ſuch thing, eſpecially under the term of reconciliation, hath not been pleaſing unto his Lordſhip. But thereof your Lordſhip can make the beſt judgment by the anſwer you received from him. I do but gueſſe thereat, by what I have heard he hath been pleaſed to ſay, and the manner wherewith he hath uſed me: Which hath been ſuch, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves (which moſt afflicted me) have out of compaſſion pitied me. Yet I may with much truth aſſure your Lordſhip, that I have not omitted towards him either any reſpect or ſervice that was fit for me to perform, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards his perſon, or the high place he holdeth in my Maſters favour, or unto his preſent imployment; well knowing how unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſcandalous a thing it is for the Miniſters of a Prince to run different wayes in a ſtrange Court, but have attended him in all his publique audience, and uſed in all kinds that reſpect and obſervance towards him, that I think malice her ſelf cannot charge me with an omiſſion. And my Lord, this is the truth, whatſoever may be ſaid or written to the contrary: It is true, that ſome four moneths ſince in a buſineſſe that no leſſe concerned his Majeſtie and the Prince's ſervice, then abruptly to have broken off all our Treaty, I was far differing from my Lords opinion; And thereupon happened betwixt us ſome diſpute in debate of the buſineſſe, but without any thing that was perſonal, and there was no creature living at it but the Prince, to whoſe Cenſure I ſhall willingly refer my ſelf. In me I proteſt it unto your Lordſhip, it made no alteration, but within half an hour I came to him with the ſame reverence and reſpect that I was wont to do, the which I have continued ever ſince, ſo that I have much wondered how it cometh to be ſo much ſpoken of in <hi>England,</hi> that my Lord Duke and my ſelf ſhould live here at too much diſtance. And I cannot find any other reaſon for it, but that every body hath taken ſo much notice of my ill, and contemptible uſage, that they think it unpoſſible for any Gentleman, but to be ſenſible of it. But if any one diſreſpect, or omiſſion from me towards my Lord Duke can be truly inſtanced in by any man, I will be contented to incur his Majeſties high diſpleaſure, and your Lordſhips Cenſure.</p>
               <p>For the preſent Newes here, it is, that the ninth of this Moneth, the Prince intendeth (God willing) to begin his journey for <hi>England.</hi> And the day before, I conceive the Contract will be. The <hi>Infanta</hi> is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111544:30"/>to follow in the Spring, and the Prince hath commanded my ſtay here. I know not how things may be reconciled here before my Lord Dukes departure, but at preſent, they are in all extremity ill, betwixt this King, and his Miniſters, and the Duke, and they ſtick not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that they will rather put the <hi>Infanta</hi> headlong into a Well, then into his hands. I write unto your Lordſhip you ſee with much freeneſſe, and I intreat you let it remain with you.

               <p>Since the departure of the Prince, there have every day paſſed Letters of extraordinary affection between the King, and the Prince; and the love that is here generally born unto the Prince is ſuch, as cannot be well believed by thoſe that daily hear not, what paſſeth both from the King and his chief Miniſters. And to ſay the truth, his Highneſſe hath well deſerved it; for in the whole time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, he hath carried himſelf with the greateſt affability, patience, and conſtancie, and at his departure-with the greateſt bountie, and liberality, that I think hath been known in any Prince in our times. And I proteſt unto your Lordſhip as a Chriſtian, that I never heard in all the time of his being here, nor ſince any one exception taken againſt him, unleſſe it were for being ſuppoſed to be too much gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by my Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who is indeed very little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their good opinion of him, and departed from hence with ſo little ſatisfaction, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are in doubt, that he will endeavour all that ſhall be poſſible to croſſe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: Wherein certainly they are very much miſtaken; For my
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111544:30"/>Lord cannot but be obliged a ſervant for any particular diſtaſtes of his own to croſſe the advancement of his Majeſtie, and the Prince's ſervice, eſpecially in a buſineſſe of ſo high Conſequence as this.</p>
               <p>It may be your Lordſhip will hear many Complaints, and that the Match never was, nor yet is intended; I beſeech your Lordſhip to give little belief in that kind, and the effects will now ſpeedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth, if the fault be not on our ſide. It is true that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have committed many errours in their proceedings with the Prince; but the buſineſſe is now by the Prince overcome, if we our ſelves draw not back: For which I confeſſe I ſhould be heartily ſorry, and ſo I conceive would moſt honeſt men; for if this match, and the alliance with <hi>Spain</hi> hath been ſo long deſired by his Majeſtie, and that for it he hath been pleaſed to do ſo much, and the Prince to take ſo hazardous a voyage, if all the ſame r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſons are yet on foot, which have ever moved the King and Prince to wiſh the match; if to this may be added, that his Majeſtie hath overcome all the difficulties on his part, and that both he, and the Prince do ſtand ingaged for the performance of it, as far as Princes can be, God forbid, that any particular diſtaſtes, or misunderſtandings (which God knoweth have little relation to the buſineſſe) ſhould be of power to diſturb it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now, when the Match is paſt all danger of miſcarrying, the portion, and all temporal Articles ſettled, and I hope to the Kings Content, and all other good effects that could be expected by this allyance in a very fair way, I hope there will be no cauſe of doubt in this kind; if there ſhould be, I am ſure that your Lordſhip would put to a helping hand to keep the buſineſſe from being overthrown, ſince you have done ſo much for the overcoming of former difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the bringing it to the paſſe 'tis now in. If there be no cauſe of writing this, I beſeech your Lordſhip to impute it to my zeal to the buſineſſe, and my freeneſſe with your Lordſhip, upon whoſe true love and friendſhip I ſo much rely, as I ſhall not forbear to tell you, any of my fears. I hope within 3. daies Sir <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> will be able to begin his journey towards your Lordſhip. He will tell you many truths, being on my knowledge, as hearty a ſervant and friend as 'tis poſſible for your Lordſhip to have. He hath told me how much I am bound to your Lordſhip for your love, and favour, and truly I will deſerve it the beſt I can, and that I think will be onely by loving you, for otherwiſe I conceive I am like to have little means of meriting at any bodies hands, yet at your Lordſhips it may be I may, by being a man of honeſty, and honour; And ſuch an one I will lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

               <p>I muſt now crave leave to ſpeak unto your Highneſſe like a faithful plain ſervant, which is, if your Highneſſe pleaſure be to have uſe made of the Powers you have left in my hands; I no way doubt, but in this particular ſuch ſatisfaction will be given, as will appear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to all the world.

Firſt it will be of great diſcomfort to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who until the <hi>Depoſorio's</hi> are paſt, is not her own woman, but muſt be governed by the pleaſure of the <hi>Junto,</hi> which I think ſhe is very wearie of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till then may ſhe declare her ſelf to be yours, nor Comply with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:111544:31"/>your Higheſſe in anſwering of your Letters, and Meſſages, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you thoſe reſpects, and Comforts, which I know ſhe would be glad to do. But if ſhe ſhould any way judge, that the delay of the <hi>Depoſorios</hi> ſhould ariſe from your Highnes part, I conceive ſhe would take it moſt heavily. Secondly, it will certainly raiſe great jealouſies in this King, and his Miniſters, and retard the reſolutions, that are fit to be taken with ſpeed for the putting in execution that which is capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated. I therefore offer it unto your Highnes wiſdom, whether upon the ſatisfaction, which they will give in this particular, which will be whatſoever you can deſire; and upon the agreement of the temporal articles your Highneſſe would upon the coming of the Popes appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation make any farther ſcruple in the delivering of your Highneſſe powers; If I ſhall, I am confident they will not preſſe it, as not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for the womans part to urge the haſting of the Marriage. But I conceive it will caſt ſuch a cloud of Jealouſie and diſtruſt upon the buſineſſe, that beſides the diſcontent and affliction, which I know it will give the Infanta (which moſt worketh upon me,) it will ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the buſineſſe, that it will make a ſtand in your whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and preparations, wherein they now go on chearfully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, and I conceive will punctually perform all that they have capitulated with your Highneſſe. I dare not ſo much as give my ſelf leave once to queſtion your Highneſſe intentions of proceeding to the real effecting of the match, which makes me deſirous that all things may be executed, that may any way retard or diſturb it. Only I ſhall like a faithful poor ſervant preſume to ſay thus much to your Highneſſe; That for divers years paſt, I know the King your father, and your ſelf, have held this the fitteſt Match in the World, and by a deſire of effecting it, your Highneſſe was induced to undertake that hazardous journey of coming to this Court in perſon. In the time of your being here, (admitting that their proceedings have been in many things unworthy of you.) And that divers diſtaſtes have grown by intervenient accidents; Now things are reduced to thoſe terms, that the Match it ſelf is ſure, the portion, and the temporal Articles ſettled (I hope to the Kings liking and yours) And all other good effects that could be hoped for by this alliance, are in a fair way. If to theſe reaſons may be added, That on his Majeſtie and your Highneſſe part, you have already paſſed by, and overcome the main difficulties; and your Highneſſe by your journey hath ſatisfied your ſelf of the perſon of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> God forbid, that either any perſonal diſtaſtes of Miniſters, or any indiſcreet, or paſſionate car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of buſineſſes ſhould hazard that, which his Majeſtie and your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111544:32"/>Highneſſe have done ſo much to obtain, and whereby doubtleſſe ſo much good, and peace is to accrew to Chriſtendom by the effecting of it; and contrariwiſe ſo much trouble and miſchief by the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of it. Beſides the individual happineſſe of your Highneſſe in ſuch a Wife, which the World ſuppoſeth you infinitely eſteem for her perſon. And for her Birth and Portion is no where to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; And queſtionleſſe for her vertue, and ſettled affection to your Highneſſe deſerveth you better then any woman in the World. I humbly crave pardon for writing unto your Highneſſe in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which I hope your Highneſſe well enough knowes, neither the benefits I have received from <hi>Spain,</hi> nor their grateful uſage of me upon occaſions (nor I proteſt unto your Highneſſe any other earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect) moveth me unto it, but the zeal, and love I bear to your ſervice, for which I ſhall ever undervalue any thing, that may concern my ſelf. And therefore I ſhall conclude by intreating your Highneſſe, that if you would have things go well, that a Poſt may inſtantly be diſpatched back unto me, authorizing me to deliver the ſaid power upon the arrival of the diſpenſation, and having taken fitting ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in this particular point. And this I earneſtly beſeech your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be done with all poſſible ſpeed and ſecreſie; and that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours may not know that ever there was any ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made of the delivery of the powers. In the interim I will find means if the diſpenſation come for 20, or 24 daies to alledge ſome other fair pretexts for the deferring of the <hi>Depoſorios;</hi> But herein I deſire I may know your Highneſſe reſolution with all poſſible ſpeed, &amp;c. And ſo with, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>VVHen your Highneſſe ſhall remember, that your Highneſſe being here in perſon, it was not poſſible in leſſe then a moneth, to get that diſpatcht which you were promiſed Mr. Secretary <hi>Cottington</hi> ſhould have carried with him, if your Highneſſe would have but ſtayed him 24 hours; I hope you will pardon your ſervants although they ſometimes miſtake in the time, which they limit for the procuring of the diſpatch of buſineſſe, eſpecially if they depend
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:111544:32"/>upon the diſpatches, that are to be procured from them. I have theſe 10. daies had <hi>Greiſly</hi> in a readineſſe to depart, having every day expected a reſolution from the <hi>Junto.</hi> Firſt in point of the portion, and ſince in the daies of payment, and at laſt I have received their anſwer in them both, in ſuch ſort as your Highneſſe will ſee in the paper incloſed, which is an extract of the heads of the temporal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that we have agreed, although I have onely conſented unto them <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> until I ſhall receive his Majeſties approbation and yours: In the point of the portion, I have had a tough and a knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty piece of work, by reaſon that not onely the <hi>Conde de Olivarez,</hi> but all the <hi>Junto</hi> were abſolutely ignorant of what had paſſed in the late Kings time, which I foreſaw, and that was the cauſe that I moved ſo earneſtly at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> to have the <hi>Conde de Gondomar</hi> remain here. They made many preſidents to be ſearched, and found that the <hi>two millions</hi> demanded was four times as much as ever was given with any daughter of <hi>Spain</hi> in money. They alledged that it would be ſaid, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was fain to purchaſe the friendſhip and alliance of <hi>England;</hi> that this would be ſuch a preſident, as that Spain here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after muſt marrie no more daughters. I onely inſiſted that it was a thing, by the laſt King ſettled, and agreed with me, that this King had by ſeveral anſwers in writing to me undertaken to purſue the buſineſſe as it was left by his father, and to make good whatſoever he had promiſed. And thereupon deſired that the original Papers, and <hi>Conſultos</hi> of the laſt King might be ſeen, which very honeſtly by the Secretary <hi>Cirica</hi> were produced, and appeared to be ſuch, that I dare ſay, there was not a man that ſaw them, that doubteth of the laſt Kings real intention of making the Match. And queſtionleſſe this had been the uſefulleſt occaſion to have diſavowed former proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and I was reſolved to put them to it. But both the King and his Councel upon the ſight of what had been promiſed by his father, preſently took reſolution to make good the two millions, onely to remonſtrate unto his Majeſtie the vaſtneſſe of the Portion, and to deſire him to conſider how far the King had ſtretched himſelf in this particular for his ſatisfaction. And therefore, that he would have Conſideration of it in ſuch things for the future, as might be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of betwixt them, and their Kingdoms. As for the daies of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I inſiſted to have had half a million upon the <hi>Depoſories,</hi> half a million to be carried along with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and the other million at their Fleets the two next years after by equal portions. But I have now received the Kings anſwer in this particular, which your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will ſee in the encloſed paper; as likewiſe what I have done
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111544:33"/>therein by the Copie of the diſpatch, which I now write about it to Mr. Secretary. So not having any thing more to add concerning this particular, I recommend your highneſſe to Gods holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I Have received ſo much comfort by the care which I ſee in your grace to take all occaſions to honour, and favour me, that I ſhould
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111544:34"/>be glad (if it were poſſible) in my affection to your perſon, and in my deſire to ſerve you, that your grace might ſee ſomething in me above what you cold find in any other ſervant. What an honeſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe can be. I am, and what an honeſt ſervant can yield you, ſhall be ever vigilant in me to ſerve you. Since the departure of the laſt poſt (by whom I wrote lately unto your Grace) my Lord of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi> hath had audience with this King (taking me along with him) to whom his Lordſhip repreſented the King our Maſters deſire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Palatinate in conformity to what his Majeſty hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his late letters, we are now ſoliciting to haſten this kings anſwer, which we hope we ſhall ſhortly ſend unto his Majeſty, and there is no diligence omitted by my Lord of Briſtol, nor my ſelf (that we can think on) to negotiate ſuch an anſwer, as may be to his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties good liking. The Diſpatches from <hi>Rome</hi> are not yet come, but by letters which they have lately received from the Duke of <hi>Paſtrana;</hi> it is advertized, that all things are concluded, and that he would ſend them away within a few dayes. By my Lord of <hi>Briſtols</hi> Letter to his Majeſty, your grace will underſtand the reſolution, which his Lordſhip hath taken concerning his proceedings upon the arival of of the diſpaches from Rome: his Lordſhips hath communicated with me his Majeſties Letter, and deſired my opinion concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which he had taken, wherein I have concurred with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not underſtanding it any way to be differing in ſubſtance from his Majeſties directions; the altering of the day mentioned in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties letters being onely the changing it from a time when the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are of no force, to a time when they may be of uſe: the putting of any thing in execution in the one time, or in the other, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Majeſties, and his Highneſſes further directions. I have hitherto underſtood, that his Majeſty and his highneſſe have really affected this match, and have laboured faithfully to ſecond their deſires with my utmoſt endeavours. There is none I am ſure a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter witneſſe then my ſelf of the affection which your Grace hath born unto it, which I have ſeen remain conſtant through many tryals. And therefore until I underſtand the contrary from your ſelf, I muſt believe that your deſires are the ſame, which I have ſeen them. I muſt ever ſpeak my heart freely unto your Grace, and confeſs that upon the letter which I received from his Highneſſe, and upon the ſight of his Majeſties to my Lord of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I have been jealous of his Majeſties heart and his Highneſſe, that they are not that to the match which they have been; but theſe are but diſtruſts of my own, and not founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient to ſlacken or cool thoſe diligences which I daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111544:35"/>in conformity to his Majeſties, and his Highneſſe Commands, and to what remains apparent of their deſires. I ſhall therefore hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſire your Lordſhip to open mine eyes, and if I am out of the way to let me ſtraight, for I have no affections of mine own, but what agrees with my Maſters, and will ever ſubmit with all humility my ſelf, and my judgment unto his Majeſties wiſedome, and faithfully labour to ſerve him accordingly to what I ſhall underſtand to be his will and pleaſure. But untill I know by your Graces favour by what Compaſſe to guide my Courſe, I can onely follow his Majeſties revealed will; and will once take the boldneſſe to repreſent unto your Grace in diſcharge of what I owe you theſe Conſiderations, which my deſire to ſerve you, forceth from me. I do look upon your Grace as a perſon infinitely provoked to be an enemy to this match, and believe, that you have had repreſented unto you many reaſons, ſhewing how much it concerns you to ſeek to break it, with all the force you have: But I can neither believe, that the errour of one man can make you an enemy to that, which brings along with it ſo much happineſſe and content unto his Majeſtie, and his Highneſſe: nor that your Graces judgment can be led by thoſe arguments, that under the colour of ſafety, would bring you into a dangerous laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. Your Grace hath given noble teſtimonie, how little you have valued your own ſafety in reſpect of his Majeſties ſervice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aſſure my ſelf you would contemn all Conſiderations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf, that might hinder the advancement of his Majeſties ends. In the proceeding to this Match, there is the ſame convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his Majeſtie, that ever hath been, there is the ſame Lady, the ſame portion, the ſame friendſhip deſired, they profeſſing here an exact complying with what is capitulated, and a reſolution to give his Majeſtie ſatisfaction in whatſoever is in their power. From your Grace none can take away the honour of having been the principal means by which this great buſineſſe hath been brought to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And whatſoever others may ſuggeſt againſt your Grace, the <hi>Infanta</hi> truly informed, cannot but underſtand you the perſon to whom ſhe owes moſt in this buſineſſe. Your Grace, and the <hi>Conde Olivarez,</hi> have fallen upon different waies, that which concerns the honour of the King our Maſter, being different to that, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood concerned moſt his Maſter, your ends were both one for the effecting of the Match, and with the Concluſion of it, he cannot but better underſtand you. Would your Grace would commit it to my charge to inform the <hi>Infanta</hi> what you have merited, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate all other miſtakes here concerning the proceeding. If
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111544:35"/>your Grace would reconcile your heart, I would not doubt, but with the Concluſion of the Match to compoſe all things to your good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and to bring them to a truer underſtanding of you, and of their obligation unto you. In what a Sea of Confuſions the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this alliance would ingage his Majeſtie, I will leave to your Lordſhips wiſdom to conſider of, it being too large a diſcourſe for a Letter.</p>
               <p>I will therefore onely deſire your Lordſhip to conſider, that even the moſt proſperous War hath misfortune enough in it to make the Authour of it unhappie: of which how innocent ſoever your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is, the occaſions that have been given you, will ever make you liable to the aſperſion of it. This I write not unto your Grace as thinking to divert you from what you are falling into; for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident your heart runs a more peaceable way: but I am willing, that you ſhould ſee, that howſoever others ſhould be inclined to carrie you into this tempeſt, it concerns you, in your care of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and your own, to divert them from it. I humbly deſire your Grace to pardon this errour of mine (if it be one) which I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe with the affection, and infinite deſire, which I have to ſee you ever happie and flouriſh.</p>
               <p>Concerning my ſelf, your Grace knowes my wants, and I doubt not but your Care is what I could wiſh. I ſhould be glad when you have done with <hi>Peter Wych</hi> to ſee him diſpatched away with ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies unto me, which I ſhall be in extream want of by <hi>Chriſtmaſſe,</hi> my debts beſides in <hi>England</hi> being clamorous upon me for ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

               <p>MY Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> intended to have diſpatched away a Poſt unto his Majeſtie this night with the advice of the arrival of the diſpenſation, which came to this Town the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this moneth, hoping that he ſhould have been likewiſe able to have given to his Majeſtie, and his Highneſſe a clear account of all things concerning it. But the deliverie of the Queen this morning (who is brought to bed of a daughter) hath ſtopped all negotiation, and I believe it will be theſe two daies before he can be ready to ſend him away. There is no noveltie (as I yet underſtand) that is come with the diſpenſation; there will be ſomething deſired for better explanation of his Majeſties, and his Highneſſe intentions, and ſome omiſſions there are which as they underſtand was his Highneſſe intention ſhould have been in the Capitulation, they being promiſed by his Highneſſe. But I do not find that theſe will be any ſtop to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For they do preſſe my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> very much to proceed preſently to the <hi>Depoſories.</hi> Your Grace ſhall underſtand all things more particularly by the next Poſt. I do now make the more haſte, forbearing to trouble you with other occurrences, leſt my Letters come ſhort of the departure of the Poſt, as they did of his who was laſt diſpatched from hence.</p>
               <p>I do moſt humbly deſire your Grace to continue the doing me thoſe offices that may continue me in his Majeſties and his Highneſſe good opinion, and I doubt not but I ſhall be ever able to let your Grace ſee that you have not a more faithful ſervant, then he which your Grace hath moſt bound to be ſo, and that ſhall ever remain</p>

                  <hi>The Lord Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>to</hi> Sir Walter Aſton.</head>
               <p>IN your Letter of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of December, you deſire me to give you my opinion, my ancient acquaintance, long cuſtome of loving you, with conſtancie of friendſhip invites me to do you this office of good will, and to ſerve you according to your requeſt. And for your
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111544:36"/>more intire ſatisfaction, I will deliver the things in the paſt and preſent. You in all the beginning of the treaty won to your ſelf a good eſtimation, while you were onely at large in the treaty, and had communication of the paſſages from the Lord of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> as by courteſy: and in his abſence handled no farther in the treaty of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage then by direction from him. When the <hi>Prince</hi> was there, your carriage gave his Highneſſe and my ſelf all ſatisfaction. Now you muſt give me leave to put you in mind of the freedom uſed with you whileſt we were at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and of the explanation, the <hi>Prince</hi> made of himſelf to you by his Letters from <hi>St. Anderas.</hi> From which you might obſerve, the reſentment the <hi>Prince</hi> had of their proceedings with him. And by his Highneſſe declaration to you from thence, you might ſee both his care and reſolution not to ingage himſelf into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage without good conditions for the Pallatinate, and Conſervation of his honour every way. My care and my intentions were to move increaſe of honour to you, and to recompence by a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be layed in his Majeſtie towards you, which I purſued ſo ſoon, as I came to the Kings preſence. And the <hi>Princes</hi> confidence was ſo great in you, as he joyned you in the Commiſſion, beſides he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf to you by his Letters, not leaving you thereby to gueſſe at his Majeſties directions to the E. of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which he was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to you. Now you may think how ſtrange it was to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and how much I was troubled (not being able to make your excuſe) when your joynt Letters made known, how you had concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to ingage his Highneſſe by prefixing a day for the <hi>Depoſorios,</hi> without making certain the reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and Electoral dignity, the portion and temporal articles. Which proceeding of yours with the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Lords of the Committee, as they took reſolution once, to adviſe his Majeſtie to revoke both the Lord of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and you, upon thoſe grounds, which you will underſtand by his Majeſties own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Secretarie <hi>Conwayes</hi> Letters written to you with this diſpatch. I was not able at firſt by any endeavour to oppoſe the reſolution of your revocation, ſo far had you caſt your ſelf into miſconſtruction, and given ſtop to the progreſſe of your own advancement. But with conſtant induſtry and time, I have won this point, of qualifying all ill opinion of you, and ſufferance of your continuing there. So as it will be now in your power (by your Carriage) to come off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproof. And I ſhall hope to overcome the reſt with time, to to bring you again to the condition of honour and recompence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident that ſince you ſee your own errour, and acknowledge it,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111544:37"/>you will be careful by a ſtiff and judicious carriage to warrant all your preſent and ſucceding actions. If you think at firſt ſight I preſſe you a little hard upon this point, you may be pleaſed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it to be a faithful way of ſatisfying your requeſt, and expreſſion of my affection to have you to do all things ſuitable to your wiſdome virtue and honour, and according to the wiſhes of</p>

               <p>I Had not leiſure in my former diſpatch, being haſtie to write the reaſon why I wondered at, the errour you commited in the laſt diſpatch of my Lord of <hi>Briſtols</hi> and yours; for the matter is, that his Majeſtie having plainely written unto you both in his former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch, that he deſired to be aſſured of the reſtitution of the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, before the <hi>Depoſorium</hi> was made, ſeeing he would be ſorrie to welcome home one Daughter with a ſmiling cheer, and leave his own onely Daughter at the ſame time weeping and diſconſolate. And the <hi>Prince</hi> having alſo written unto you, that he never meant to match there, and be fruſtrated of the reſtitution of the Palatinate ſo often promiſed, that notwithſtanding this clear Language, you ſhould have joyned with my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> in a reſolution of ſo haſtie a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Prince's <hi>Proxie,</hi> before you had received his Majeſties anſwer to your former diſpatch, wherein my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> urged of his Majeſtie a harſh anſwer and direction, and his Majeſtie cannot but take it for a kind of Scorn, that within 4. dayes after ye had urged his Majeſties anſwer, ye ſhould in the mean time take reſolutions of your own heads. You may do well, becauſe there is no leiſure in this haſtie diſpatch for his Majeſtie to anſwer my Lord of <hi>Briſtols</hi> laſt Letter (which wil be done by the next duplicate of this ſame diſpatch) to acquaint him in the mean time with this Letter, which his Majeſtie himſelf hath dictated unto me.

               <p>I Have comitted to the truſt and ſecreſie of this bearer Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> (whom I find your Graces faithful ſervant) certain advertiſements to be delivered by him unto you; which as one that ſhall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) in all things ſhew himſelf your paſſionate ſervant, I could no way conceale from you.

               <p>I have in all things with ſo much affection deſired to ſerve your Grace every way to your ſatisfaction, that it hath infinitely afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that I ſhould have done any thing, whereby I might leſſen your favourable opinions towards me, but I hope your Grace hath by this time ſet me ſtraight both with his Majeſtie, and his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and reſtored me to the ſame place in your affection, which I have formerly had.

I do now herewithal ſend an account unto his Majeſtie of my proceedings upon his Commands, which I do intreat your Honour to be pleaſed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111544:39"/>to preſent unto him, as alſo farther to acquaint his Majeſtie, that I have already ſpoken with divers of theſe Miniſters, and given them ſuch a declaration of his Majeſties good intentions in the preſſing at this ſeaſon for the reſtitutions of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and Electoral dignity unto the Prince his Son in Law, as I have order to do by the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but do find they are here ſo poſſeſſed with the ill relations they receive out of <hi>England,</hi> that I with much difficultie can ſcarce give them any kind of ſatisfaction. I have acquainted the <hi>Conde Olivarez</hi> with the anſwer, which your honour, and Mr. Secretarie <hi>Calvert</hi> had received from their Embaſſadours touching their audiences, the <hi>Conde</hi> himſelf having formerly acquainted me with their Complaint. His anſwer now was, That he underſtood they had acknowledged unto your Honours to have received from his Majeſtie in that point all kind of ſatisfaction, but that after you were gone the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ynoiſa</hi> wrote a Letter to Secretarie <hi>Calvert,</hi> telling him, that he did not well remember himſelf, of what had paſſed at his being there, but had ſince called to mind, that he had procured ſome audiences with the Prince with much difficultie. To which I anſwered the <hi>Conde,</hi> That it ſeemed the Marqueſſe was very light of his advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to give ſuch informations as might breed ill underſtandings betwixt Princes, and eſteem them of no more Conſequence, then to forget what he had advertiſed with ſo much eaſe. Concerning that malitious report here raiſed of the Prince's treating a marriage in <hi>France.</hi> I deſire your Honour to let his Majeſtie know, that it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed hither out of <hi>England</hi> as a thing ſo certain, that there is not a Miniſter of State (excepting the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Gondomar</hi>) that hath not given ſome credit unto it. I have therefore according to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties directions given ſuch declarations touching the author and believers of it, as your Honour in his Majeſties name hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me. I have likewiſe received by Mr. <hi>Greiſly</hi> your Letter of the 31. of the laſt: In anſwer of which, all that I ſhall need to ſay here unto your Honour is, that my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> hath received your former Letter, acquainting him with his Majeſties pleaſure concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame buſineſſe, from whom his Majeſtie will receive an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof. This is all that I have to ſay to your Honour at this preſent touching thoſe particulars mentioned in your Letter; I ſhall now here further acquaint you with ſuch advertiſements, as I conceive may any waies have reference unto his Majeſties ſervice. My Lord of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and my ſelf repairing ſome few daies ſince unto the <hi>Pardo,</hi> having conference with the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Olivarez,</hi> his Lordſhip acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Conde</hi> with the Letters of revocation, which he had received
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111544:40"/>from his Majeſtie, and withal deſired that he would procure him licence to take his leave of the King. The <hi>Conde</hi> anſwered his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, That he had much to ſay unto him by order from his Majeſtie, the ſubſtance of his ſpeech was; That they had received large ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements out of <hi>England,</hi> by which they underſtood the hard meaſure that he was there likely to ſuffer by the power of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that the onely crime, which they could impute unto him, was for labouring to effect the marriage, which his Maſter could not but take much to heart, and held himſelf obliged to publiſh to the world the good ſervice that my Lord had done unto the King of great <hi>Brittain;</hi> and therefore for the better encouragement likewiſe of his own and all other Miniſters that ſhould truly ſerve their Maſters, he was to offer him a blank paper ſigned by the King, wherein his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might ſet down his own Conditions, and demands; which he ſaid he did not propound to corrupt any ſervant of his Majeſties, but for a publique declaration of what was due unto his Lordſhips proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He ſaid further, that in that offer, he laid before him the Lands, and Dignities, that were in his Maſters power to diſpoſe of; out of which he left it at his pleaſure to chooſe what eſtate, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he ſhould think good, adding thereunto ſome other extravagant and diſproportionable offers. My Lords anſwer was, That he was very ſorry to hear this language uſed unto him, telling the <hi>Conde,</hi> that his Catholique Majeſtie did owe him nothing, but that what he had done was upon the King his Maſters Commands, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intention to ſerve <hi>Spain.</hi> And that howſoever he might have reaſon to fear the power of his enemies, yet he truſted much upon the innocency of his own Cauſe, and the Juſtice of the King, and that he could not underſtand himſelf in any danger: but were he ſure to loſe his head at his arrival there, be would go to throw down himſelf at his Majeſties feet and mercy, and rather there die upon a Scaffold, then be Duke of <hi>Infantada</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> On the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this moneth, there was declared here in Councel a reſolution of this King, to make a journey to his frontier Towns in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> with an intention to begin his journey upon the 29. of this moneth <hi>Stil. Vet.</hi> And as I am informed his Majeſtie will there entertain himſelf the greateſt part of theſe three moneths following; ſo that his return hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not be until the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> My Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> hath ſent divers to the <hi>Conde</hi> for leave to diſpeed himſelf of the King, but in reſpect of his Majeſties being at the <hi>Pardo,</hi> he hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to delayed, and hath yet no certain day appointed for it: But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it will be ſometime this week. The Cauſe of the delaying of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:111544:40"/>his Lordſhips admittance to the King, as I underſtand is, that the ſame day that his Lordſhip ſhall declare his revocation to the King, they will here in Councel declare the revocation of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ynoiſa.</hi> Howſoever in reſpect of the Kings departure, (at which time they uſe here to embarge all the mules, and means of carriage in this Town) I believe his Lordſhip will not begin his journey ſo ſoon as he intended.</p>
               <p>All the relations which are lately come out of <hi>England</hi> do wiſh them to entertain themſelves here with no farther hopes, that there is any intention to proceed to the Match; and this advice comes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch a report of the ſtate of all things there, that hath much irritated all theſe Miniſters, and let looſe the tongues of the people againſt the proceedings of his Majeſtie, and Highneſſe. I labour as much as I can, and as far as my directions will give me latitude, to give them better underſtandings of the real intentions of his Majeſtie and Highneſſe: but divers of them cleerly tell me, That I profeſſe one thing, and the actions of his Majeſtie and Highneſſe (upon the which they muſt ground their belief) are differing from it. I ſhall therefore here in diſcharge of my duty advertize your Honour, that they do here expect nothing but a War, about which they have already held divers Councels, and go ſeriouſly to work, preparing themſelves for what may happen. Which I deſire your Honour to advertize his Majeſtie, being high time, as far as I am able to judge, that am here upon the place, that his Majeſtie do either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon ſome courſe for the allaying of theſe ſtorms; or that he go in hand with equal preparations. Having obſerved in former times, the ſtrange rumours that have run in <hi>England</hi> upon ſmall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; I have thought it fit to prevent the credit which may be given to idle relations by advertizing your Honour that I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how any great attempt can be made from hence this year; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever buſineſſes ſhould go. The Squadron of the Kings Fleet (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>Don Fadrique de Toledo</hi>) is come into <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and joyned with that which <hi>Don Juan Taxardo</hi> is Captain of. And as I am credibly informed, this King will have by the end of <hi>April</hi> between 50. and 60. Gallions at Sea. It is true that other years the number commonly falls ſhort of what is expected, and their ſetting forth to Sea ſome moneths later then the time appointed, but there is extraordinary care taken this year, that there be no default in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The chief end (that I can underſtand) of this Kings journey being to ſee the Fleet of Plate come in, to take view of his Armado, and ſee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111544:41"/>them put to Sea. That which I underſtand is onely left alive of the Marriage here is, that the Jewels, which the Prince left with this King for the Infanta and her Ladies, are not yet returned, but it is intimated unto me, that if the Letters which they ſhall receive out of England upon the anſwer they have given to his Majeſtie about the buſineſſe of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> be no better, then ſuch as they have lately received, they will return the Jewels, and declare the buſineſſe of the Match for broken. I ſhall therefore intreat your Honour to know his Majeſties pleaſure how I ſhall carry my ſelf, if they be offered unto me, being reſolved in the mean time untill I ſhall know his Majeſties pleaſure, if any ſuch thing happen, abſolutely to refuſe them. The Princeſſe ſome few daies ſince fell ſick of a <hi>Calentura,</hi> of which ſhe remaineth ſtill in her bed, though it be ſaid ſhe is now ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I will conclude with many thanks for your friendly advertize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning my own particular, which (God willing) as far as I can, I will obſerve, and do earneſtly intreat you, that you will pleaſe to continue the like favours unto me, which I ſhall highly eſteem of. And ſo with a grateful acknowledgment of my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I reſt</p>

               <p>I Have advertized by former diſpatches, that the Parliament here had granted unto this King 60 millions of Duckats to be paid in 12 years, which with 12 millions which remain yet unpaid of what was given the King at the laſt Seſſion, this King was to receive 72 millions in the 12 years next following. I ſhall now acquaint your Honour, that there are only 19. Cities that have voice in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that each of them do ſend hither two <hi>Provadores,</hi> (as they call them here) but theſe have no power finally to conclude any thing, but what is agreed on by them is to be approved of by the ſaid Cities or the greateſt number of them before it have the force of an Act of Parliament, and that therefore there hath been all poſſible art uſed to procure the Cities to confirm what hath been granted by their <hi>Procuradores</hi> touching the 60. millions; and it is here thought
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111544:41"/>that one of the motives of this Kings journey was, hoping by the authority of his preſence to procure the conſent unto the ſaid gift of the 4. Cities which he is to paſſe by in this journey, namely <hi>Cordova, Sivel, Joen,</hi> and <hi>Granado,</hi> it being here doubted, that the ſaid Cities might make great oppoſition to the ſaid grant, notwithſtanding his Majeſtie hath not had ſuch ſucceſſe as was expected. But <hi>Cordova</hi> which was the firſt City with which his Majeſtie began, hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to give their Conſent, letting his Majeſtie underſtand, though in as fair and reſpectful terms as they could expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. That it was a demand impoſſible for them to Comply withal. What the ſucceſs of this may be is doubtful, <hi>Cordova</hi> having given but an ill example to the other Cities, and yet it is rather believed here, that the greateſt number of them being under the Command of ſuch as are either this Kings ſervants, or abſolutely under his diſpoſe, that his Majeſtie will be able to overcome the buſineſſe, and they are now buſie how to ſettle the manner of the leavie of the ſaid ſum by yearly and equal portions.</p>
               <p>They having found here divers inconveniences in their new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Portugal</hi> by way of Governours, are reſolved to place Vice-Kings again there. And for to gratifie the Emperour have elected for that charge his third Brother <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> who is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make his repair thither. On the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the laſt moneth, my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> took his leave of the Queen and the Infanta, and on the Sunday following being the 29. of the ſaid moneth, his Lordſhip delivered unto me the Powers which his Highneſſe left with him, and thoſe which have been ſince ſent hither. His Lordſhip is preparing for his journey, and ſaith that he is already in ſuch a forwardneſſe, as upon the arrival here of Mr. <hi>Greiſley,</hi> or any other from <hi>England,</hi> whereby he ſhall receive means for the taking up of moneys here, he will preſently put himſelf upon the way. The Queen here ſome few daies ſince fell ſuddenly ill, and ſwooned two or three times, but her indiſpoſition laſted not above two or three dayes; Her Majeſtie is now (thanks be to God) very well again. The King having received advice thereof intended (as it is ſaid) to come preſently poſt hither, but upon better news, his Majeſtie proceeds in his journey, and for any thing that I can underſtand, it will be <hi>May</hi> before his return to this Town.</p>
               <p>There are lately thrown abroad in this Town divers Copies of a Proclamation pretended to be publiſhed in <hi>Ireland</hi> bearing date the 27. of January laſt. It hath made a great noiſe here, and divers of their Miniſters have ſpoken with me about it, they conceiving it to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111544:42"/>be contrary to what hath been lately Capitulated. For my part, I have been able to give them no anſwer, not having yet underſtood from your Honour, nor any of his Majeſties Miniſters, of any ſuch Proclamation. I have ſeen the Proclamation as it came printed from thence, and do here incloſed ſend your Honour a Copy thereof, deſiring you that you will acquaint his Majeſtie therewithal, that he may be pleaſed to Command therein what to his wiſdom ſhall ſeem fit. To thoſe that have ſpoken with me about this Proclamation (having firſt diſclaimed the having had knowledge of any ſuch thing) I have uſed diſcourſes of mine own touching the abuſes of thoſe which are called titulary Archbiſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. letting them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand here, that if thoſe kind of people have been buſie there to plant ſecretly their Government, they have far exceeded the favour which was promiſed them, and given his Majeſtie juſt cauſe to give order for the reformation.</p>

               <p>IN a former Diſpatch which I lately made unto your Honour, I ſent unto you the Copy of a Letter, which I then had newly received from the Secretarie <hi>Don Andreas de Prada,</hi> by which he advertiſed me, That the King his Maſter (according to what I had requeſted by memorial) had commanded, that all Engliſh Commodities and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures (which I have long ſince advertized were prohibited by <hi>Prematica's</hi> publiſhed here for the reformation of abuſes) ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into theſe Kingdoms. I have long ſince performed divers dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences my ſelf, both with the Secretary, and Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> for the procuring a declaration of the ſaid order, being careful to prevent ſuch inconveniences as the King our Maſters Subjects might fall into for want thereof. But having been toſſed up and down between the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111544:42"/>Secretarie, and the Preſident with ſeveral delayes, the one remitting me to the other. I repaired to the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Olivarez</hi> (ſuſpecting ſome novelty in the buſineſſe) and acquainted him, that upon the receipt of a Letter ſent me from the Secretary <hi>Don Andreas de Prada,</hi> concerning the free entrance of Engliſh Commodities, I had given notice by a Copy of the ſaid Letter unto the King my Maſter of what was therein Commanded, and had likewiſe advertiſed the Merchants that reſide in theſe Kingdomes of the ſaid Order. I alſo gave him account of the ſeveral diligences which I had performed with the Preſident, and the Secretary, for the procuring a declaration thereof, and deſired that he would preſently command that there might be ſuch courſe taken, that there ſhould be no further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes uſed therein, ſince I ſhould be loath to ſee the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Subjects encouraged by the ſaid Order to repair hither with their Merchandizes, and fall into inconveniencies for want of notice given thereof unto their Miniſters in the Ports. The <hi>Conde</hi> fell into diſcourſes far from my expectation, asking me whether it was not free for any King, in his own Kingdom, to Command his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to wear what he pleaſed, ſaying further, that the Engliſh were not prohibited to bring in their Commodities, but that the King his Maſter might command his Subjects to ſpend the Bayes, and other Commodities of his own Kingdoms, and not to make uſe of thoſe that came from forraign parts, as to his wiſdom for the good of his Kingdoms ſhould ſeem beſt. That there ſhould be a ſuſpenſion of the execution of the ſaid <hi>Pramatica's</hi> until S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>James-tide,</hi> and no longer. To which I anſwered, That I made no doubt of the power, that every King had over his own Subjects; notwithſtanding where it was articled betwixt two Kings, that there ſhould be a free admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of each others Commodities unto their ſeveral Kingdomes, and after a Command ſhould be given prohibiting either of them unto their Subjects the making uſe thereof, it could not but be underſtood a defrauding and deluding of the Articles, and the true intention of them: but I told him I came not to diſpute this now, for the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries Letter had deſired me to take notice of another reſolution, therefore I deſired, that there might be a ſpeedy and publique decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made of what was therein ſignified unto me: or if there were any new reſolution, that I might underſtand it. To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered (pretending that he ſpake it as a freedom which he uſed with me) but came out with it in ſuch a manner, as I ſaw he was full of it) That the truth was, that they would proceed here, as they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded withal in England. That the King my Maſter had lately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111544:43"/>leave to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to tranſport Artillery out of England, and had denied the like to their Embaſſadours having required it; which was (as he ſaid) directly againſt the articles of peace, wherein it was Capitulated, That neither ſhould aſſiſt with any kind of armes the enemy of the other. He ſaid farther, That the Engliſh had taken <hi>Ormuh,</hi> and there was no ſatisfaction given concerning that buſineſſe, nor appearance of any intention to do it, and concluded, That when the Articles of Peace ſhould be obſerved to them, they would do the like. I told the <hi>Conde</hi> I had not underſtood any thing of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which he mentioned, and therefore could ſay nothing unto him; neither thought I fit to give him any further anſwer, being loath in a buſineſſe of this importance, where the Articles of Peace between theſe Kingdoms are in queſtion, to do any thing at gueſſe, but to advertiſe it to the King my Maſter, and to proceed according to ſuch order as he ſhall pleaſe to give me. I do therefore intreat your Honour, that you will be pleaſed to acquaint his Majeſtie with what hath paſſed, wherein I doubt not but his Majeſtie will obſerve the diſtraction, and inconſtancy of their proceedings here at preſent, in Commanding, what his Majeſtie will have found by this Secretaries Letter, and taking preſently after new reſolutions. After this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which the <hi>Conde</hi> hath uſed unto me, I cannot expect any reaſon or juſtice here, and the Merchants have many ſuites depending where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have received great injuries, whereof I have not hitherto complained, becauſe I was in continual hope of procuring redreſſe, and their ſuites proceeded on, I cannot ſay as I would have wiſhed, but according to the ſtile here, and in ſuch manner as they have done in former times. I doubt not but his Majeſtie will therefore likewiſe pleaſe to conſider what a ſtop there is likely to be here of all buſineſſes concerning the Commerce, and either proceed as occaſion ſhall there be offered, in the like manner, or take ſuch a Courſe for ſettling things in better order, as to his wiſdom ſhall ſeem beſt. I have fince had ſome overtures made unto me, that the ſaid declaration ſhall preſently come out, in the mean time I would not wiſh, that the Merchants ſhould adventure any thing truſting to their courteſie here. By my laſt unto your Honour which was of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>May,</hi> I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the advice which was given hither, That the Galeons, that bring the Plate, were upon the way for theſe parts; Since when there is newes of their arrival at St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> excepting two of them which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in their journey hitherward, the one ſprung a leak in a calm day, and ſunk ſo faſt, that there were onely ſaved 52 men, the reſt, which were about 200. perſons, were all drowned, neither was any
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111544:43"/>of her fraight ſaved. The other was their <hi>Admirante,</hi> which corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds with our Vice-Admiral, which likewiſe ſprung a leak, but all the men aboard were ſaved, and a good part of her ſilver. There is loſt upon Regiſter in theſe two Ships three millions, and it is thought that there periſhed in them above a million in ſilver, and goods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regiſtred.</p>
               <p>Upon order that was lately ſent unto the <hi>Aſſiſtente</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> for the perfecting the Grant of the Millions to the King by the ſaid City, there being doubt made whether it was a lawful Conceſſion, or no; The <hi>Aſſiſtente</hi> called together thoſe, that had voices in the ſaid grant of the ſaid Millions, and made a ſpeech unto them, wiſhing a general Conformity to what his Majeſtie had deſired of them; but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was very diſtaſtful unto the greater number, who little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have heard that buſineſſe revived again. And the people having gotten notice upon the breaking up of that meeting of what had been there propounded, in a tumultuous manner ran after the <hi>Aſſiſtente,</hi> who was returning to his houſe, and hearing ſuch a cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour behind him, thought that the people had been diſquieted by ſome accident, and ſtayed to have appeaſed them, but by the curſes which he heard, and the blowes he received by the ſtones which were thrown at him, he quickly found againſt whom the fury of the people was bent, and ſo made all the haſte he could to his own houſe, which at length he recovered ſore wounded, and with much hazard of his life.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts, and others of that Kingdome which reſide in this Court, begin to grow very buſie here, and do promiſe great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto this King in the aſſiſtance which his Majeſtie ſhall find in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whenſoever he ſhall pleaſe to attempt any thing againſt that Kingdome; but for any thing I can learn, there hath been as yet ſo little ear given unto them, that they have not deſcended to make any particular offer. But they are treated here with much Courteſie, <hi>Tyr-Connel</hi> being made a Page to the Queen, and the reſt receiving good ſatisfaction. I will be as vigilant as I can to trace out their ſteps, and I hope I ſhall be able to give ſeaſonable advertizement of their proceedings. Howſoever ſince ſecret Councels may be held, and reſolutions taken, which I may miſſe of; I doubt not but the King our Maſter conſidering the preſent jealouſies, and diſtaſtes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe Crowns, will be vigilant to ſecure that Kingdom, that there may be nothing neglected upon which they may here take any ſudden advantage. By the Engliſh Merchants that reſide in <hi>Malaga</hi> I have received advice, that 3. <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Maſters of Ships have lately had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111544:44"/>a ſentence pronounced againſt them by the D. of <hi>Medina Sidona,</hi> wherein their Ships and all their goods are confiſcated, for having brought <hi>Holland</hi> Commodities to that Port, and their perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Galleys; which notwithſtanding their apellation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Councel of War here, (which ought to have been admitted them) was preſently put into execution. The ſame day that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the advice, I gave in a Memorial to the Councel of State, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the rigorous and unjuſt proceeding againſt the ſaid Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Maſters, and deſired that they would ſend their order, that the Apellation might be admitted, and that their perſons might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returned off of the Gallies. I likewiſe repaired to the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Olivarez,</hi> acquainting him with the proceedings of the Duke, and was able to give him ſome examples of divers <hi>Hollanders</hi> that had been treated in the like occaſion with far leſſe rigour. Whereupon there is Command given according to what I have deſired; and whatſoever ſhall become of their goods, I have a promiſe from the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez,</hi> that their perſons ſhall be treated with all Courteſie. It is publiſhed by the Ladies of the Palace, that the Queen is with Child, which hath filled this Court with much joy, and her Majeſtie hath ſo much better health now upon her being new with Child, then ſhe hath had of the reſt, that they are already here full of hopes that ſhe will bring them a Prince, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>The Abſtract of a Letter from</hi> Sir Walter Aſton <hi>to the Lord</hi> Conway, 17. July, 1624.</head>
               <p>HE acknowledgeth the receipt of his Majeſties Letters of the 27. of June by Mr. <hi>Wych,</hi> and is buſie in preparing to put thoſe Directions in execution, and that being done, will give a ſpeedy and full account. The Marqueſſe <hi>Ynoiſa</hi> diſpatched away a Poſt to <hi>Spain</hi> from Calice, and by him gave as malicious an account of his uſage at his departure from <hi>England,</hi> and alſo of all other late paſſages there, as malice it ſelf could have dictated. He omits no libels or infamous ſongs, nor ſpares his own inventions where they may ſerve to incenſe. The Credit they are like to give to their Embaſſadour,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111544:44"/>the height of diſcontent they are now in, the aſſurance given them of the weak and mean eſtate of all things in England may tempt them to offer the giving us a blow, where we are weakeſt. And therefore no neceſſary preparations for defence to be neglected on our part. None of their Armado ſtirres yet, but only 4. Gallions appointed to accompany for ſome daies the <hi>Nova Eſpagna</hi> Fleet that put to Sea the fourth of this preſent.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Walter Aſton</hi> doubts, that the light he hath received of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of things in England, and the Arguments to anſwer their Objections will hardly be applyed to give any ſatisfaction. (things being in ſo much diſtemper there) And where the beſt anſwers on both ſides are recriminations, he conceives little is to be expected but a direct falling out. The cauſe of their retarding <hi>Mendoza's</hi> coming for England hath been their deſire to ſee the iſſue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with their Embaſſadour. All the Grandees, and principal perſons of Spain are ſummoned to give their attendance with their armes, which is done by three Letters. 1. <hi>Admonitoria.</hi> 2. <hi>Apercibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria.</hi> 3. <hi>Executoria.</hi> The two firſt are already ſet forth. And there is order likewiſe given for the <hi>Battalon</hi> to be in a readineſſe, which is the ſame as the Trained Bands in England. This is an ancient practiſe there upon ſuſpition of forraign invaſion, or domeſtique Commotion. There are leavies new making according to cuſtome, for ſupplying of Garriſons; and though theſe Leavies are greater then uſually, yet not much worthy of note. An Embaſſadour arrived there for <hi>Denmark;</hi> his coming being given out to be to negotiate the buſineſſe of the Palatinate, and to make overtures for a Peace with Holland: but if nothing be heard of this in England, it is not like to be true. A Requeſt preſented unto the King by a <hi>Conſulta</hi> from the Inquiſiter general, &amp;c. to procure a <hi>Jubile</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> for expiation of the late great Contempt done by a Frenchman to the Sacrament.

In his anſwer to the <hi>Conſulia</hi> there is a paſſage, that intimates his intention of looking abroad with his armes. The Frenchman was condemned, burnt publiquely, and dyed a Roman Catholique. There have been divers proceſſions in expreſſion of the general grief for that action. The King, Queen, his Brothers and Siſter, with the Grandees, and the Councel went in proceſſion about the two ſquare Courts of the Palace, where there were 4. Altars built, one by the Kings care, the reſt by the Queen, the Infanta, Cardinal, <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and <hi>Dona Maria,</hi> who joyned in the care of one of them. The
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:111544:45"/>greateſt riches of Diamonds and Pearls that were in the Churches thereabouts, and in the Kings ſtore were preſented on thoſe Altars, and were at ten millions.

               <p>THe Portugal Armado put to Sea on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the laſt moneth <hi>Stil. Vet.</hi> It conſiſts of 22. Ships of War, 4. Victuallers, and two ſmall Pinnaces of Advice: There goeth in it neer upon 4000. Land Souldiers. From Cadiz I have now freſh advice, That <hi>Don Frederique</hi> is ſtill in the Port, with the Fleet which he Commands, but himſelf and his men all embarqued. That Armado conſiſteth of ſome 35. Ships of War, and about 8000. Souldiers, and both the Fleets are victualled for 8. moneths. That of Fortugal had firſt order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>Don Frederique</hi> at the <hi>Cape St. Vincent,</hi> but hath ſince received command to proceed on the journey. It being now 27. dayes ſince the Fleet departed, and this remaining ſtill in the Harbour, doth give me much cauſe of jealouſie: eſpecially underſtanding, that they have here advice, (which they give credit to) that the Troops lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> are ſent to ſuccour <hi>Breda,</hi> fearing (if it be ſo) that they laying hold of it as a breach of the Peace (which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation I meet with in every diſcourſe) ſhould preſently fall with this Armado upon ſome part of Ireland.

Sithence I wrote my other Letter unto your Grace, (which accompanies this) I underſtand the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour by order from the King his Maſter, hath given account unto this King of the Concluſion of the Match betwixt the Prince his Highneſſe, and Madam <hi>Chriſtiene</hi> his Maſters Siſter. Whereupon this King, and the whole Court put on <hi>Galas:</hi> I conceive (howſoever I have not heard any thing thereof by any Letter unto me) that this is ground enough to Congratulate with your Grace this good beginning which I ſhall affectionately

My humble ſuit is for <hi>Walgrave,</hi> a Benefice with Cure in <hi>North-hamptonſhire,</hi> where I have laid out all my eſtate in temporal Lands.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that if it be found, that the Biſhop is to joyn with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidentiaries of <hi>Pauls</hi> in the repair of the Church, his Majeſtie would qualifie me by a <hi>commendam</hi> to hold one of my own Prebends, when it ſhall fall to be a Reſidentiarie alſo; that if I be charged with the burthen of Reſidentiarie, I might enjoy the profits of a Reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarie.</p>

               <p>AN unfortunate occaſion of my Lords Grace his killing of a man caſually (as it is here conſtantly reported) is the cauſe of my ſeconding of my yeſterdayes Letter unto your Lordſhip. His Grace (upon this accident) is by the Common Law of England to forfeit all his eſtate unto his Majeſtie, and by the Canon Law (which is in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111544:47"/>force with us) irregular, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and ſo ſuſpended from all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical function, until he be again reſtored by his Superiour, which (I take it) is the Kings Majeſtie in this rank, and order of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall juriſdiction. If you ſend for D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lamb</hi> he will acquaint your Lordſhip with the diſtinct penalties in this kind. I wiſh with all my heart, his Majeſtie would be as merciful, as ever he was in all his life; but yet I held it my duty to let his Majeſtie know by your Lordſhip, that his Majeſtie is fallen upon a matter of great advice, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. To adde affliction to the afflicted (as no doubt he is in mind) is againſt the Kings nature; to leave <hi>virum Sanguinum,</hi> or a man of bloud, Primate and Patriarch of all his Churches, is a thing that ſounds very harſh in the old Councels, and Canons of the Church. The Papiſts will not ſpare to deſcant upon the one and the other. I leave the knot to his Majeſties deep wiſdom to adviſe and reſolve upon. A theume falne into mine eye (together with the rumour I laſt wrote unto your Lordſhip about) hath faſtened me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my bed. which makes this Letter the more unhandſome. But I will take nothing to heart, that proceeds from his Majeſtie, or from that King, who hath raiſed me from the duſt, to all that I am. If the truth were ſet down, 1. That my ſelf was the firſt mover for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Keeper. 2. That his Majeſtie hath promiſed me upon the relinquiſhing of the Seal (or before) one of the beſt places in this Church, as moſt graciouſly he did. 3. The year and a halfs proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left out, which is to no purpoſe, but to ſcare away my men, and to put a diſgrace upon me. 4. That my aſſiſting Judges were defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and named by my ſelf, which your Lordſhip knowes to be moſt true: Such a declaration would neither ſhame me, nor blemiſh his Majeſties ſervice in my perſon. And it were fitter a great deal, the penning thereof were referred to my ſelf, then to Mr. Secretarie, or the Lord Treaſurer, who (if he had his demerit) deſerves not to hold his ſtaffe half a year. I do verily believe, they will haſten to finiſh this act, before I ſhall hear from your Lordſhip, which if they do, God ſend me patience and as much care to ſerve him, as I have, and ever had to ſerve my Maſter; And then all muſt needs be well. I ſend your Lordſhip a Copy of that ſpeech I have thought upon, to deliver at <hi>London</hi> upon Munday next at the Commiſſion of the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: If his Majeſtie have leiſure to caſt his eye thereupon, and to give direction to have any thing elſe delivered, or any point of this ſuppreſſed, I would be directed by your Lordſhip whom I recommend in prayers to Gods good guiding and protection. And do reſt, &amp;c.</p>

Wherein you may ſee what is expected from me, that I may not onely magnifie his Majeſties Gracious dealing with me, but cauſe all my friends to do the like, and reſtrain them from making any extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of my errours, which if they be diſpoſed to do, or not to do is impoſſible for me to alter, that am not likely for a good time to ſee any other then mine own family. For my ſelf, I ſhall ever be ready (as is fit) to acknowledg his Majeſties favour to me, but can hardly perſwade my ſelf, that any errour by me committed, deſerved more puniſhment then I have had, and hope that his Majeſtie will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that I ſhould not confeſſe my ſelf to have been ſubject to a Star-chamber ſentence, which God forbid I ſhould ever do.

For my part it is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trouble to me, and of ſo ſmall moment, as I meane to move no more for it. When this bearer returns, I beſeech you return by him this incloſed Letter, and beleive that whatſoever I am I will ever be, Your Lordſhips moſt aſſured friend to do you ſervice.</p>

And doubt nothing of my Lord Admirals remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of you upon the firſt opportunity. Great works (as I hope this will be a perfect reconciling of his Majeſties affections to you, of your beſt ſtudies, and endeavours to the ſervice of his Majeſtie) do require ſome time: They are but poore actions, and of no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that are Slubbered up in an inſtance. I know (my Lord) mens tongues are their own, nor lieth it in your power to preſcribe what ſhall be ſpoken for you, or againſt you. But to avoid that <hi>Complacentia</hi> (as the Divines call it) that itching, and inviting of any interpretation, which ſhall ſo add to your innocencie, as it ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Kings mercie, which (I ſpeak as I would do before God) had a great cloud of jealouſies, and ſuſpitions to break through, before it came to ſhine upon you. This (I take it) is the effect of my Lords exhortation, and I know it ever hath been your Lordſhips reſolution. How far you could be queſtioned in the Star-Chamber, is an unſeaſonable time to reſolve. The King hath waved off all judgment, and left nothing for your meditation, but love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the increaſing of both theſe. Yet I know (upon my late occaſions to peruſe Preſidents in that Court) that ſmall offences have been in that Court (in former times) deeply cenſured. In the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond (for the Court is of great antiquity) Henry Lord <hi>Beaumout,</hi> running a way of his own about the invading of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and diſſenting from the reſt of the Kings Councel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his abſenting himſelf from the Councel Table was fined and impriſoned: though otherwies a moſt worthy and deſerving No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man. But God be thanked your Lordſhip hath no cauſe to trouble your head about theſe meditations. For (if I have any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) you are in a way to demean your ſelf as you may expect ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more new additions, then ſuſpect the leaſt diminution from his Gracious Majeſtie. For mine own part, aſſure your ſelf, I am your true and faithful ſervant, and ſhall never ceaſe ſo to continue, as long as you make good your profeſſions to this Noble Lord. Of whoſe extraordinary goodneſſe, your Lordſhip, and my ſelf are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reflections. The one of his ſweetneſſe in forgetting of wrongs, the other of his forwardneſſe in conferring of courteſies.</p>
               <p>With my beſt reſpect to your Lordſhip and my Noble Lady, and

                  <hi>The Lord Keeper to the Duke, concerning the Lord of</hi> St. <hi>Albons,</hi> October 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1621.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>My moſt noble Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have received your Lordſhips expreſſion concerning the Pauſe I made upon the two Patents. The Proclamation of writing to the Kings hand, and my Lord of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Albons</hi> pardon. The former I have ſealed this morning in duty, and obedience to your Lordſhips intimation. The latter I have not yet ſealed, but do repreſent (in all lowlineſſe and humility) theſe few Conſiderations by your Lordſhip to his ſacred Majeſtie, wherein let your Lordſhip make no queſtion, but I have adviſed with the beſt Lawyers in the Kingdom. And after this repreſentation, I will perform whatſoever your Lordſhip ſhall direct.</p>
               <p>His Majeſtie and your Lordſhip do conceive,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that my Lord of St. Albons pardon and grant of his fine came both together to my hands, and ſo your Lordſhip directs me to paſſe the one and the other. But his Lordſhip was too cunning for me. He paſſed his fine (whereby he hath deceived his Creditors) ten dayes before he preſented his pardon to the Seal. So as now in his pardon, I find his Parliament fine excepted, which he hath before the ſealing of the ſame obtained and procured. And whether the houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament will not hold themſelves mocked and derided with ſuch an exception, I leave to your Lordſhips wiſdom. Theſe two Grants are oppoſite and contradictory (in this point) the one to the other.</p>
               <p>The King pardons in particular words,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> All ſums of money and rewards taken for falſe judgments or decrees. And therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Parliamentary Cenſure (being inflicted but for the ſame taking of moneys and rewards) coming a good way after falleth too late in Law, and is of no force to ſatisfie the Lords (as I am informed) and I believe this clauſe was never ſeen in any other pardon.</p>
               <p>The King pardoneth in my Lord of St.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Albon,</hi> the ſtealing away, altering, raiſing, and interlining of his Majeſties Rowles, Records, Briefs, &amp;c. which are more in a Lord Chancellors pardon, then the imbezeling of his Majeſties jewels in a Lord Chamberlains. And yet the Lord Chancellour <hi>Elsmore</hi> could not indure that clauſe in my Lord of <hi>Sommerſets</hi> Pardon, unleſſe he would name the jewels in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I will not meddle or touch upon thoſe miſtakings which may fall between the Parliament and his Majeſtie, or the mis interpretation that enemies may make hereof to your Lordſhips prejudice, becauſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:111544:49"/>I ſee (in his Majeſties great wiſdom) theſe are not regarded. Onely I could have wiſhed, the Pardon had been referred to the Councel board, and ſo paſſed. I have now diſcharged my ſelf of thoſe poor ſcruples, which (in reſpect onely to his Majeſties ſervice, and your Lordſhips honour) have wrought this ſhort ſtay of my Lord of St. <hi>Albons</hi> Pardon. Whatſoever your Lordſhip ſhall now direct, I will moſt readily (craving pardon for this not undutiful boldneſſe) put in execution. Becauſe ſome ſpeech may fall of this dayes ſpeech, which I had occaſion to make in the Common Pleas, where a Biſhop was never ſeen ſitting there theſe 70. years, I have preſumed to incloſe a Copy thereof, becauſe it was a very ſhort one.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip ſhall not need to take that great pains (which your Lordſhip to my unexpreſſible comfort hath ſo often done) in writing. What Command ſoever your Lordſhip ſhall impoſe upon me as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this pardon, your Lordſhips expreſſion to Mr. <hi>Packer</hi> or the bearer ſhall deliver it ſufficiently. God from heaven continue the ſhowring and heaping of his bleſſings upon your Lordſhip, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>VVIth my trueſt affections, and thankfulneſſe premiſed. I do not doubt but his Majeſtie and your Lordſhip do now enjoy the general applauſe of your goodneſſe to the Earl of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton.</hi> Saturday laſt he came, and dined with me, and I find him more cordially affected to the ſervice of the King, and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips love and friendſhip, then ever he was, when he lay a priſoner in my houſe. Yet the Sunſhine of his Majeſties favour, though moſt bright upon others (more open offenders) is noted to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what eclipſed towards him. What directions ſoever his Majeſtie gave, the order is ſomewhat tart upon the Earl. The word of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, ſpread about the City (though I obſerved not one ſyllable ſo quick to fall from his Majeſtie) his Keeper much wondred at. The act of the Councel publiſhed in our names, who were neither preſent thereat, or heard one word of the ſame: yet upon my credit the Earl takes all things patiently, and thankfully, though others wonder at the ſame.</p>
               <p>Mr. Secretary ſigned a Petition of one <hi>Rookwood</hi> a Papiſt, and priſoner in the Fleet upon five ſeveral executions, that I ſhould grant
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:111544:50"/>him his liberty. The Kings name is uſed, and the mediation of the Spaniſh Embaſſadour. If I breaking rules ſo fouly in favour of a Papiſt, (which I am reſolved to keep ſtraight againſt all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever) I ſhall infame my ſelf in the very beginning. If his Majeſtie will have any ſpecial indulgence in this kind, I expect intimation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the King, or your Lordſhip, and no third Perſon. Your Lordſhip will not expect from me any account of Councel bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, nor the ſetting at liberty of the late priſoners. Mr. Secretary is ſecret enough for imparting any thing unto me, ſo as I muſt remain in a neceſſary ignorance.</p>
               <p>There is a Country man of mine one <hi>Griffith,</hi> a ſuiter unto the Court for the reverſion of an Auditors place, recommended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by his Maſter the Lord Treaſurer. The place is of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence for the diſpoſing of his Majeſties revenewes. The man is unfit for this, as preſumptuous and daring for any place. Sir <hi>Robert Pye</hi> ſaith, he hath already written to your Lordſhip, and I doubt not of your care thereof. Doctour <hi>Lamb</hi> (the bearer) is a very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and (for ought I ever heard of him) an honeſt man. The King hath imployed him in diſcovery of counterfeit Witchcrafts, in reforming of no ounterfeit, but hearty Puritanes, and he hath done good ſervice therein. If his Majeſtie (now in our pure ayr of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamptouſhire</hi>) do not ſhew him ſome favor, or grace, either by Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by uſing him courteouſly, The Brethren (having gotten out their <hi>Yelverton</hi> again) will neglect and moleſt him too unſufferably. God from Heaven bleſſe you. Remember your Deanerie, and Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Beſeech your Lordſhip to interpret this Letter well, and fairly, which no malice (though never ſo provoked) but my duty to his Majeſtie, and love to your Lordſhip hath drawn from me: both which reſpects as long as I keep inviolably, I will not omit for the fear of any man, or the loſſe of any thing in this world, to do any act, which my Conſcience ſhall inform me to belong unto that place, wherein the King by your favour hath intruſted me. I received this morning two Commands from his Majeſtie, the one about a Penſion of 2000 <abbr>l.</abbr> yearly, and the other concerning the office of the Earle <hi>Marſhal,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:111544:50"/>both conferred on the Right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Arundel.</hi> For the former, although this is a very unſeaſonable time to receive ſuch large Penſions from ſo bountiful a King, and that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo ſoon approaching is very like to take notice thereof, and that this penſion might (under the correction of your better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) have been conveniently deferred until that Aſſembly had been over. Yet who am I that ſhould queſtion the wiſedom, and bounty of my Maſter? I have therefore ſealed the ſame, praying ſecretly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to make his Majeſtie as abounding in wealth as he is in goodneſſe. But the latter I dare not ſeale (my good Lord) until I heare your Lordſhips reſolution to theſe few Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Whether his Majeſtie by expreſſing himſelf in the delivery of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſtaffe to my Lord of <hi>Arundel,</hi> that he was moved thereunto for the eaſing of the reſt of the Comiſſioners, who had, before, the execution of that office, did not imply, that his Majeſtie intended to impart unto my Lord no greater power, then was formerly granted to the Lords Comiſſioners. If it were ſo, this Pattent ſhould not have exceeded their Pattent, whereas it doth inlarge it ſelf beyond that by many dimenſions.</p>
               <p>Whether it is his Majeſties meaning,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Pattent leaping over the powers of the three laſt Earles, <hi>Eſſex, Shrewsbery,</hi> and <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> ſhould refer onely to my Lords own Anceſtors, <hi>Howards,</hi> and <hi>Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayes</hi> Dukes of Norfolk, who clamed this place by a way of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The uſual reference of Pattents being unto the laſt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate predeceſſour, and not unto the remote, whoſe powers (in thoſe unſettled and troubleſome times are vage, uncertain, and unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be limited.</p>
               <p>Whether it is his Majeſties meaning,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that this great Lord ſhould beſtow thoſe offices, ſettled of a long time in the Crown, Sir <hi>Edward Zouch</hi> his in the Court, Sir <hi>George Reinel's</hi> in the Kings Bench, and divers others. All which this new Pattent doth ſweep away, being places of great worth and dignity.</p>
               <p>Whether that his Majeſties meaning, and your Lordſhips,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that my Lord <hi>Stewards</hi> place ſhall be (for all his power of Judicature in the <hi>Verge,</hi>) either altogether extinguiſhed, or at leaſtwiſe ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated unto this new Office? A point conſiderable, becauſe of the greatneſſe of that perſon, and his neerneſſe in bloud to his Majeſtie, and the Prince his Highneſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Whether it be intended,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that the offices of the Earl Marſhal of England, and the Marſhal of the Kings houſe, which ſeem in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times to have been diſtinct offices, ſhall be now united in this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:111544:51"/>great Lord? A power limited by no Law, or Record, but to be ſearcht out from Chronicles, Antiquaries, Heralds, and ſuch obſolete Monuments, and thereupon held theſe 60 years, (for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his power was clearly bounded, and limited) unfit to be revived by the policy of this State.</p>
               <p>Theſe Queſtions, if his Majeſtie intended onely the renewing of this Commiſſion of the Earl Marſhals in my Lord of <hi>Arundel</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and to the purpoſe. But if his Majeſtie aymed withal, at the reviving of this old office, <hi>A la ventura,</hi> whoſe face is unknown to the people of this age; upon the leaſt intimation from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I will ſeal the Patent. And I beſeech your Lordſhip to pardon my diſcretion in this doubt, and irreſolution. It is my place to be wary what innovation paſſeth the Seal. I may offend that great Lord in this ſmall ſtay, but your Lordſhip cannot but know, how little I loſe, when I loſe but him, whom without the leaſt cauſe in the world, I have irreconcileably loſt already. All that I deſire is, that you may know what is done, and I will ever do what your Lordſhip (being once informed) ſhall direct as becometh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That there is a difference betwixt the Earl Marſhal, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of the Kings houſe; See <hi>Lamberts Archiron:</hi> or of the High Courts of Juſtice in England</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Circa Medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marſhal of England, and the Conſtable are united in a Court, which handleth onely Duels out of the Realm, matters within the Realm, as Combats, Blazon, Armorie, &amp;c. but it may meddle with nothing tryable by the Lawes of the Land.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal of the Kings Houſhold is united in a Court with the Seneſchal or Steward, which holds plea of Treſpaſſes, Contracts, and Covenants made within the Verge, and that according to the Lawes of the Land, <hi>Vid. Artic. Super Cart.</hi> C. 3.4.5.</p>
               <p>We do all of us conceive the King intended the firſt place only for this great Lord, and the ſecond to remain in the Lord Stewards ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging. But this new Patent hath comprehended them both. This was fit to be preſented to your Lordſhip.</p>

               <p>I Have ſeen many expreſſions of your love in other mens Letters (where it doth moſt naturally and purely declare it ſelf) ſince I received any of mine own. It is much your Lordſhip ſhould ſpare me thoſe thoughts, which pour out themſelves in my occaſions: But to have me and my aſſaires in a kind of affectionate remembrance, when your Lordſhip is ſaluting of other Noble men, is more then ever I ſhall be able otherwaies to requite then with true prayers and beſt wiſhes. I received this afternoon (by Sir <hi>John Brook</hi>) a moſt loving Letter from your Lordſhip, but dated the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your care over me for the committing of one <hi>Beeſton</hi> for breach of a Decree. My Noble Lord, Decrees once made muſt be put in execution, or elſe, I will confeſſe this Court to be the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, and Grievance in this Kingdom. The damned in Hell do never ceaſe repining at the Juſtice of God, nor the priſoners in the Fleet, at the Decrees in Chancery; of the which hell of priſoners this one, for antiquity and obſtinacy may paſſe for a Lucifer. I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know him, nor his cauſe, but as long as he ſtands in Contempt, he is not like to have any more liberty.</p>
               <p>His Majeſties laſt Letter, though never ſo full of honey (as I find by paſſages reported out of the ſame, being as yet, not ſo happy as to have a ſight thereof) hath notwithſtanding afforded thoſe Spiders which infeſt that noble Houſe of Commons, ſome poyſon, and ill conſtructions to feed upon, and to induce a new diverſion, or plain Ceſſation of weightier buſineſſes. His Majeſtie infers, (and that moſt truly, for where were the Commons before <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt gave them authority to meet in Parliaments?) that their priviledges are but Graces and favours of former Kings, which they claim to be their inheritance, and natural birthrights. Both theſe aſſertions (if men were peaceably diſpoſed, and affected the diſpatch of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bufineſſes) might be eaſily reconciled.</p>
               <p>Theſe priviledges were originally the favours of Princes, and are now inherent in their perſons: Nor doth his Majeſtie go about to impair or diminiſh them. If his Majeſtie will be pleaſed to qualifie that paſſage with ſome mild and noble expoſition, and require them ſtrictly to prepare things for a Seſſion, and to leave this needleſſe diſpute his Majeſtie ſhall thereby make it appear to all wiſe and juſt men, that theſe perſons are oppoſite to thoſe common ends, whereof
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:111544:52"/>they vaunthemſelves the onely Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Will the King be pleaſed therefore to add in this Letter (which muſt be here neceſſarily upon Munday morning) that if they will not prepare bills for a Seſſion, his Majeſty will break up this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any longer Prorogation, and acquainting the Kingdom with their undutifulneſſe and obſtinacy, ſupply the preſent wants by ſome other meanes. Or will his Majeſty (upon their refuſal) preſently rejourn the the Aſſembly until the appointed 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of Feburary. This courſe is fitteſt for further advice, but the other to expreſſe a juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. I dare adviſe nothing in ſo high a point, but humbly beſeech almighty God to illuminate his Majeſties underſtanding to inſiſt upon that courſe, which ſhall be moſt behoveful for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his ſervice. In our houſe his Majeſties ſervants are very ſtrong, and increaſe every day nor is there the leaſt fear of any Malignant oppoſition.

Now that his Majeſtie or any of his Predeceſſors, did ever diſpence with a Lay-man to hold cure of ſouls, I think will be hard for any man to ſhew by any warrantable preſident, or record whatſoever.

This will give ſatisfaction to all the Church, bring him into this place according to ſtatute, and the foundation of that dead King, prevent ſuch a dangerous preſident for a Lay-man to poſſeſſe cure of ſouls in the Eye, and Center of all the Realm, and by an everlaſting teſtimony of his Majeſties Piety to the Church of England. Thirdly, what opinion this Gentleman hath of our Church government is better known to his Majeſtle, then to me. If he ſhould be averſe thereunto, it were ſuch a blow unto the Church (the number of the Fellowes and Students there conſidered) as the like were never given by publique authority theſe 50 Years.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:111544:53"/>the Earl of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> who neither regarded the Church, Learning, nor Honour in any meaſure as you do, have ever afforded every Dean of this Church. When I had (to my thinking) given the Knight Marſhal full, and too much ſatisfaction, this day a Letter was offered to the Table (in my preſence) violently purſued by the Lord Steward, and the Earl Marſhal, to command this liberty, (which had ſtood unqueſtioned theſe 700 years) to ſhew reaſon to Mr. Attourney, and Mr. Solliciter, why they preſcribe againſt the Knight Marſhal. A Courſe (as my Lord Preſident ſaid openly) not to be offered to any ſubject of England. It is our Charter, and freehold of inheritance, to be ſhewed only in a Court of Juſtice, and at the Kings Bench, which we are very ready to do. And we may as well be queſtioned by a Letter from the Councel, for all the Land we have, as for this. My Lord, the juriſdiction of this place brings not a penny to my purſe, but it hath brought much ſorrow to my heart, and now teares to my eyes, that I ſhould be that unfortunate Contemptible man, who for all the King, and your Lordſhips favour, and the true pains I take in anſwer thereunto, muſt be trampled down above all the Deans that lived in this place. Nor would it ever grieve me, if I had deſerved it from theſe Lords by the leaſt diſreſpect in all the world.

               <p>MY Lord <hi>Brook</hi> diſwarning me (from his Majeſtie) from coming to <hi>Theobalds</hi> this day, I was enforced to trouble your Lordſhip with theſe few lines. My moſt humble thanks for your Lordſhips moſt free, and moſt loving Letter, I do willingly confeſſe my errour, yet ſtill of the mind, that your Lordſhip only, who juſtly taxed it, hath made it to be an errour. If your love to me had not exceeded all reaſon, and deſert of mine, my complaints were not effects of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, but of a real ſuffering, and miſery. I do confeſſe (and reſt ſatisfied withal) that his Majeſties Juſtice, and your Lordſhips love are anchors ſtrong enough, for a mind more toſſed then mine is, to ride at. Yet pardon me, my Noble Lord, upon this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if I exceeded a little in paſſion, the natural effect of honeſty, and innocency. A Church-man, and a woman, have no greater Idol under heaven, then their good name. And yet they cannot fight at all. Nor with credit, ſcold, and leaſt of all recriminate, to protect and defend the ſame. Their onely revenge left them, is to grieve, and complain.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:111544:56"/>
               <p>My miſery I took to be this. I am one of thoſe that labour in his Majeſties Cole-mines under the earth, and out of ſight. My pains from five a clock in the morning to 10. or 12. at night are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and endleſſe, but under earth, and out of his Majeſties ſight. What other men do (or but ſeem to do,) it is ever before the Kings face, and if his Majeſtie will not look on it, if he hath eares about him, he ſhall be told of it ſo often by the parties themſelves, that he muſt hear of it whether he will or no.</p>
               <p>And as my ſervice (by this remoteneſſe is hidden from the King, ſo is it liable to be traduced to the King, and my relief (as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatching the motions of poor men by Petitions allowable to my orders,) made to be a Grievance to the Common Wealth. But in all theſe fourteen dayes (wherein by the voice of the City, I have remained a priſoner in my houſe,) where is that one party grieved, that hath troubled his Majeſtie with Complaints againſt me? One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Lord Marſhal hath dealt with my noble Lord Marqueſſe <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Carlile,</hi> my Lord Treaſurer (as your Lordſhip may ſoon know by asking the queſtion) to make a faction to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the poor Lord Keeper, who never dreamt thereof.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Gilbert Haughton</hi> hath complained to my Lord Treaſurer of my men for taking, (<hi>Hugh Holland</hi> was by and heard him;) If your Lordſhip do but ask him his reaſon, I think it will appear how well grounded their complaints be. Upon thoſe two former Anchors I will therefore reſt, and that ſo far from Cowardlineſſe, that I will either challenge them before his Majeſtie to make good their ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, or elſe (which I hold the greater valour of all, and which I confeſſe I wanted before this check of your Lordſhips) go on in my Courſe, and ſcorn all theſe baſe, and unworthy ſcandals as your Lordſhip ſhall direct me.</p>
               <p>I have ſent a Copy of a Letter of mine to my Lord <hi>Anan,</hi> which his Majeſtie hath ſeen, and given his aſſent it ſhould not be kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; yet I would humbly crave your Lordſhips opinion thereof (by Mr. <hi>Packer</hi>) before any Copy goeth from me.</p>

               <p>I Will ſpeak with the Jeſuit to morrow, and deliver him his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition from the King, but do ſend your Lordſhip here incloſed a Copie, of the Conference which I procured from him without his privity, onely to make his Majeſtie, and your Lordſhip merrie. I have alſo received a Letter concerning the French Embaſſador which I will be ready to put in execution as your Lordſhips ſervant, and Deputy but not otherwiſe. Yet your Lordſhip will give me out of that freedom (which was wont to be well interpreted by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) to let your Lordſhip underſtand, that I find all buſineſſes of reſtitution of ſhips, and goods thus taken, to have been handled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Councel in Star-cham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> all the reigns of Henry 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and H. 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. without any contradiction of the Lord Admiral for the time being. But this to your Lordſhip in ſecret. I will be very careful of the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> that neither his cauſe, nor your Lordſhips reputation ſhall ſuffer thereby. And this is the account I can yet give of your Lordſhips Letter, ſave that I humbly expect that anſwer, which your Lordſhips own Luckie hand hath promiſed in the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of one of them. I would eaſe your Lordſhip in this place, but to prevent complaint that (peradventure) may be firſt invented, and then preſented. Your Lordſhip ſhall heare of a long narrative of our Councel Table diſpatches. That paſſage of our letter, which (as it now goeth) doth hope that his Majeſtie will ſpare to confer any ſuites of moment in Ireland until the return of the Iriſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, was a blunt requeſt to the King, to grant no ſuites there without our advice. Againſt this (concluded in my abſence the firſt day of the Tearm) I ſpake firſt to the Prince privately (who allowed of my reaſons) then (when the Preſident would not mend it) at the Table openly, that I did utterly diſlike we ſhould tutour his Majeſty, how to grant ſuits eſpecially in Letters, that are to remain upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. My Lord of Cantuar and the, Earle Marſhal ſaid, they had many Preſidents in that kind. I anſwered, I knew they had none but in the Kings time, and that I wiſhed them (as I do) all torn out of the book and caſt into the fire. I concealed my reaſons, which now I will reveal unto your Lordſhip, becauſe this is the third time, I have expreſſed unto your Lordſhip under my hand, my diſlike of this kind of Limiting his Majeſtie otherwiſe then by word of mouth. Firſt if his Majeſtie (which we ſee ſo often done) ſhall diſpoſe of theſe ſuites otherwiſe, here are ſo many records remaining to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:111544:57"/>litious men to obſerve his Majeſties averſeneſſe from following the advice of the Councel board.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if your Lordſhip ſhall procure any ſuit in this kind here are records alſo in time to come, that you croſſe and thwart the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Kingdom. And I pray God this be but mine own jealouſie. The paſſage in the Letter with my Prating, and his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe help was altered, and for fear of miſreporting, I make bold to relate the truth hereof to your Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>My Lords proceeded very reſolutely in thoſe reformations, which concerned other men. The Commiſſion of fees enables the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees to call before them all the Judges, as well as their under Officers (which was more then the King expreſt at Hampton Court) amongſt whom, the Lord Keeper is one, who from the Conqueſt to this day, was never ſubjected to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> call of any power in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but the King and the Parliament. And although I have not one Pennie of Fee, which hath not continued above one hundred years, yet for the honour of the Prime place in the ſtate (though now diſgraced by the contemptibleneſſe of the Officer) I am an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuiter unto your Lordſhip, that my Perſon may be exempted from the command of Sr. <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> or indeed any man els, beſides the King my Maſter. Otherwiſe I ſhall very patiently endure it, but the King hereafter may diſlike it. The Juſtices of the Peace are alſo appointed, but (if the Judges and my-ſelf be not utterly deceived) to no purpoſe in the world, nor ſervice to his Majeſtie. But when their Lordſhips came to ſurrender the under Leivtenantſhips to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties hands, whom the Lord Preſident, and I held fit to be created henceforward by ſeveral Commiſſions under the Great Seal, it was ſtiffly oppoſed, and ſtood upon, that the King ſhould name them in their Lordſhips Commiſſions onely (according to a Preſident in the late Queens time) that is, the King ſhall have the naming, but they ſtill the appointing of them. And now it was preſſed, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie intended not to diſgrace his Lords &amp;c: and your Lordſhip is to have a Letter from Mr. Secretarie to know his Majeſties mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. If his Majeſtie ſhall not ordain them to be created by ſeveral Pattents, it were better a great deal they ſhould continue as they do. I am very tedious in the manner and (peradventure) in the matter of this Letter I humbly crave pardon &amp;c.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what he had told me the night before in ſecret, to any man, to the which he did adde a deſire of ſecreſie.</p>

                     <item>1. The King had charged him and the Frier to be very ſecret.</item>
                     <item>2. The Embaſſadours did not know that he had impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe things unto me.</item>
                     <item>3. The Popes were ſecret inſtructions which they gave to the Fryer to urge and preſſe the ſame points, which himſelf had done to the King.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>He confeſſed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the greateſt part of the Friers inſtructions were to do all the worſt offices he could againſt the Duke, and to lay the breach of the marriage, and diſturbance of the peace upon him.</p>
               <p>He excuſed the bringing the Copy of that paper unto me,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe the Marqueſſe had it yet in his cuſtody, but ſaid he would procure it with all ſpeed. I deſired him to do it, the rather becauſe, beſides my approbation of the form, and manner of the writing; I might be, by it, inſtructed how to apply my ſelf, to do his Majeſtie ſervice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as I found by that Conference, his Majeſties bent, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He having underſtood, that there was, though a cloſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> yet an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble friendſhip betwixt the Duke and my ſelf, deſired me to ſhew ſome way, how the Duke might be won unto them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the peace. I anſwered I would purſue any fair courſe, that ſhould be propoſed that way; but for my ſelf, that I never meddled with matters of State, or of this nature, but was onely imployed (before this journey of the Prince's) in matters of mine own Court, and in the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>He deſired to know if they might rely upon the King,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whom onely they found peaceably addicted; otherwiſe they would ceaſe all medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and prepare for War. I anſwered, That he was a King that never broke his word, and he knew what he had ſaid unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> He commended much the courage and reſolution of the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, which I told him we all did, as a probable ſign of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>He ſaid that the Marqueſſe had diſpatched three <hi>Curreos,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and expected large Propoſitions from Spain to be made unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, concerning the preſent reſtitution of the Palatinate. And that

               <p>I Received your Graces Letter by Mr. <hi>Killegrew,</hi> ſo full of that ſweetneſſe, as could never iſſue from any other Fountain, then that one breaſt ſo fraught with all goodneſſe, and virtue; <hi>Dick Winne</hi> may write freely, (as he talks) but alas! what can my wretched ſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, that ſhould deſerve the leaſt acknowledgment from him, to whom I owe ſo infinitely much more then the ſacrificing of my life amounts to? onely my love makes me ſometimes write, and many times fear, fondly and fooliſhly, for the which I hope your Grace will pardon me. I have been frighted more about three weeks ſince (about quarrels and jarres, which now <hi>Dick Greyhams</hi> hath related in part unto the King) then at this preſent, I am. For Gods ſake be not offended with me, if I exhort you to do that, which I know you do, to obſerve his Highneſſe with all lowlineſſe, humility, and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience, and to piece up any the leaſt ſeam-rent, that heat, and earneſtneſſe might, peradventure, ſeem to produce. I know (by looking into my ſelf) theſe are the ſymptomes of good natures. And for Gods ſake I beg it, as you regard the prayers of a poor friend, if the great negotiation be well concluded, let all private diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be wrapped up in the ſame, and never accompany your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips into England, to the joy and exultation of your enemies, if any ſuch ingrateful Divels are here to be found: I am in good earneſt, and your Lordſhip would believe it, if your Grace ſaw but the tears, that accompany theſe lines.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, in your Letter to the Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton,</hi> intimate unto him your confidence, and reliance upon his watchfulneſſe, and fidelity in all turns, which may concern your Grace. I have often lied unto his Lordſhip, that your Grace hath in many of my Letters expreſſed as much, and ſo have pacified him for the time. If we did know, but upon whom to keep a watchful eye for diſaffected reports concerning your ſervice, it is all the intelligence he and I do expect. His Majeſtie (as we conceive) is reſolved to take certain oaths, which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111544:58"/>you have ſent hither, and I pray God afterward no farther difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be objected. I have had an hours diſcourſe with his Majeſtie yeſterday morning, and do find him ſo diſpoſed towards your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as my heart deſireth; yet hath been informed of the diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both with the <hi>Conde de Olivarez,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> Here is a ſtrange Creation paſſed of late, of a Vice-Counteſhip of <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> paſſed to the Heires Males, who muſt be called hereafter Vice-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe <hi>Fynch.</hi> But my Lady Dutcheſſe hath the Land, and (as they ſay) hath already ſold it to my Lord Treaſurer, or ſhared it with him. I ſtayed the Patent until I was aſſured your Lordſhip gave way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>My good Lord, becauſe I have heard, that they have in thoſe parts a conceipt of our church, as that they will not believe we have any Liturgie, or Book of common prayer at all, I have (at mine own coſt) cauſed the Liturgy to be tranſlated into Spaniſh, and fairely Printed, and do ſend you by this bearer a Couple of the Books, one for his Highneſſe, the other for your Grace. Not ſending any more unleſſe your Grace will give directions. His Majeſtie was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith, and alloweth of the buſineſſe exceedingly. The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator is a Dominican, a zealous Proteſtant, and a good Scholer, and I have ſecured him to our Church, with a Benefice, and a good Prebend. Becauſe we expect every day the diſpatching of Sr. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Cottington thitherward, I will not trouble your Grace farther at this time, but do earneſtly pray unto God to bleſſe your Grace both now and ever hereafter with all his favours and bleſſings ſpiritual and temporal.</p>

               <p>I Have no buſineſſe of the leaſt Conſideration to trouble your Grace withal at this time, but that I would not ſuffer Mr. <hi>Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to return without an expreſſion of my reſpect and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I would advertize your Grace at large of the courſe held with our Recuſants, but that I know Mr. Secretary is injoyned to do ſo, who beſt can. His Majeſtie at Salisbury having referred the ſuit of theſe Embaſſadors to the Earl of Carlile, and Mr. Secretary Conway, ſent (by their reſolutions) ſome articles unto us (the Lord Treaſurer, Secretary <hi>Calvert,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard VVeſton</hi> and my ſelf) to this effect.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:111544:59"/>
               <p n="1">1. To grant a pardon of all offences paſt, with a diſpenſation for thoſe to come to all the Roman Catholiques, obnoxious to any laws made againſt the Recuſants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then to iſſue forth two general Commands under the Great Seal, the firſt to all the Judges, and Juſtices of the Peace, and the other to all Biſhops, Chancellours and Commiſſaries not to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any Statute made againſt them.</p>
               <p>Their general pardon we have paſſed, and ſent unto his Majeſtie (from whence it is not returned) in as full and ample manner as they could deſire, and pen it. The other general and vaſt prohibition. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the reſt of the Lords to ſtop as yet, and gave (in three dayes conference) ſuch reaſons to the 2. Embaſſadors, that (although it is no eaſie matter to ſatifie the Caprichiouſneſſe of the Latter of them) yet they were both content it ſhould reſt until the Infanta had been ſix Months in England. My reaſon, if it may pleaſe your Grace, was this. Although this general favour, and connivence, whereof there are 20. of the Prime Councel know nothing as yet, muſt at laſt be known to all the Land: yet is there a great difference between the publiſhing thereof <hi>A Golpe,</hi> at one puſh, as it were, and that inſtilling of it into their knowledg by little, and little by reaſon of favours done to particular Catholiques. The former courſe might breed a general impreſſion, if not a mutinie. This Letter will but looſen the tongues but of ſome few particulars, who underſtand of their neighbours par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and having vented their diſlikes, when they have not many to Sympathiſe with them, they grow coole again, ſo as his majeſtie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards may enlarge theſe favours without any danger at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to forbid Iudges (againſt their oaths) and Juſtices of the Peace (ſworn likewiſe) to execute the law of the Land, is a thing (unpreſidented in this Kingdom <hi>et Durus Sermo</hi> a very harſh and bitter pill to be digeſted upon a ſuddain, and without ſome prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But to grant a pardon, even for a thing that is <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi> and a diſpenſation with Penal Lawes (in the profit whereof the King onely is intereſted) is uſual and full of preſidents, and examples. And yet is this Letter onely tending to the ſafety, the former but to the glory and inſolencie of the Papiſts, and the magnifying the ſervice of the Embaſſadors ends too dearly purchaſed, with the indangering of a tumult in three Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, his Maieſtie uſeth to ſpeak to his Biſhops, Judges and Juſtices of the peace, by his Chancelour, or Keeper (as your Grace well knoweth) and by his Great Seal; and I can ſignify his Majeſties pleaſure unto them, with leſſe noiſe and danger, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:111544:59"/>I mean to do hereafter, (if the Embaſſadors ſhall preſſe it,) to this effect, unleſſe your Grace ſhall (from his Highneſſe, or your own judgment) direct otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>That whereas his Majeſtie being at this time to mediate for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to many Proteſtants in forraign parts, with Princes of another religion, and to ſweeten the entertainment of the Princeſs into this Kingdom, who is as yet a Roman Catholique, doth hold a mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rigour of thoſe lawes made againſt R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nts, to be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inducement to both thoſe purpoſes, and hath therefore iſſued forth ſome pardons of Grace, and favour to ſuch Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, of whoſe faithfulneſſe and fidelity to the ſtate he reſts aſſured. That therefore you the Lords, Biſhops, Judges, and Juſtices, (each of thoſe to be written unto by themſelves) do take notice of this his Majeſties pardon, and diſpenſation, with all ſuch penal Lawes, and demean your ſelves accordingly, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus have I been too tedious and troubleſome unto your Grace, and Crave your pardon therefore, and ſome directions (which you may cauſe Sir Francis Cottington or ſome other to write, without your Graces trouble) if there ſhall apeare any cauſe of alteration. Doctor Biſhop, the new Biſhop of Calcedon is come to London pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and I am much troubled thereabouts, not knowing what to adviſe his Majeſtie in this poſture, as things ſtand at this preſent. If you were ſhipped (with the Infanta) the onely Councel were to let the Judges proceed with them preſently, hang him out of the way, and the King to Blame my Lord of Cantuar: or my ſelf for it. But before you be ſhipped in ſuch form and manner I dare not aſſent or Connive at ſuch a courſe. It is (my gracious Lord) a moſt inſolent Part, and an offence (as I take it) Againſt our common Law (and not the ſtatutes onely which are diſpenſed withall,) for an Engliſh man to take ſuch a conſecration without the Kings conſent, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to uſe any Epiſcopal Jurisdiction in this Kingdom without the royal aſſent, and Biſhops, have been in this State put to their fine, and ranſom for doing ſo three hundred years ago.</p>
               <p>I will ceaſe to to be further troubleſome and pray to Almighty God to bleſſe your Grace, and in all humbleneſſe take my leave, and reſt &amp;c.</p>

Alſo to acquaint his Majeſtie, that I ſtumble at the Proclamation (now coming to the Seal) againſt any, that ſhall draw, or preſent any bill for his Majeſties ſignature, beſides thoſe Clarks which uſually draw them up, by virtue of their places. It is moſt prejudicial to my place, the Lord Treaſurer, and the Judges <hi>itinerant</hi> who are often occaſioned to draw up, and preſent to his Majeſtie divers matters, and eſpecially pardons of Courſe. It is alſo too ſtrong a tie upon your Lordſhips hands; being intended by his Majeſtie againſt Projectors and Scriveners only. If it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſtie therefore to make an exception of the Lords of his Councel, and Judges of Aſſize, it may paſſe to the contentment of all men. Mr. Attourney ſaith he meant this exception, but I find it not ſufficiently expreſſed in the Proclamation.</p>
               <p>Alſo I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to meddle with no pardon for the Lord of St. <hi>Albons,</hi> until I ſhall have the happineſſe to confer with your Lordſhip; the pardoning of his fine is much ſpoken againſt, not for the matter, (for no man objects to that) but for the manner, which is full of knavery, and a wicked preſident.

               <p>IN the cauſe of Sir <hi>John Michel,</hi> which hath ſo often wearied this Court, vexed my Lady your Mother, and now flieth (as it ſeemeth) unto your Lordſhip, I have made an order the laſt day of the Tearm, aſſiſted by the Maſter of the Rolls, and Mr. <hi>Baron Eromley</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and with the full conſent of Sir <hi>John Michel,</hi> who then objected nothing againſt the ſame; but now in a dead vacation, when both the adverſe party, and his Councel are out of Town, and that I cannot poſſible hear otherwiſe then with one ear, he clamours againſt me, (moſt uncivilly,) and would have me contrary to all conſcience and honeſty reverſe the ſame. The ſubſtance of the order is not ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and intricate, but your Lordſhip will eaſily find out the equity or harſhneſſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Lawrence Hide</hi> makes a motion in behalf of one <hi>Strelley</hi> (a party whoſe face I never ſaw,) that whereas Sir <hi>John Michel</hi> had put a bill into this Court againſt him, and one <hi>Sayers,</hi> five years ago for certain Lands and Woods, (determinable properly at the Common Law) and having upon a certificate betwixt himſelf, and <hi>Sayers,</hi> without the knowledge of the ſaid <hi>Strelley,</hi> procured an injunction from the laſt Lord Chancellour for the poſſeſſion of the ſame, locks up the ſaid
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:111544:61"/>
                  <hi>Strelley</hi> with the ſaid injunction, and never proceeds to bring his cauſe to hearing within five years.</p>
               <p>It was moved therefore, that either Sir <hi>Johns</hi> bill might be diſmiſſed to a tryal at the Common Law, or elſe that he might be ordered to bring it to hearing in this Court, with a direction to ſave all waſtes of Timber trees (in favour of either party, that ſhould prove the true owner) until the cauſe ſhould receive hearing.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John</hi> being preſent in Court, made choice of this laſt offer, and ſo it was ordered accordingly. And this is that order, that this ſtrange man hath ſo often, of late, complained of to your Mother, and now, as it ſeemeth, to your Lordſhip. God is my witneſſe, I have never denyed either juſtice, or favour (which was to be juſtified,) to this man, or any other, that had the leaſt relation to your good and moſt noble Mother. And I hope your Lordſhip is perſwaded thereof. If your Lordſhip will give me leave (without your Lordſhips trouble) to wait upon you, at any time this day, your Lordſhip ſhall appoint, I would impart two or three words unto your Lordſhip, concerning your Lordſhips own buſineſſe.</p>

               <p>NOw that I underſtand by Sir <hi>John Hipſley</hi> how things ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Grace and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> I have done with that Lord, and will never think of him otherwiſe, then as your Grace ſhall direct. Nor did I ever write one ſyllable to that effect, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of performing true ſervice to your Grace.</p>
               <p>I was much abuſed in the Lady <hi>Hennage</hi> her Vice-Counteſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made to believe, it was your Grace's act, or elſe I had ſtayed it finally, (until the Princes return) as I did for a time. If your Grace will give any directions in matters of that nature, I can purſue them. My Lord Treaſurers ſons Wardſhip is a thing of no moment at all, and not worthy your Graces thinking of. And in good faith as far as getting, and Covetouſneſſe will give him leave, I do not ſee, but that Lord is (ſince your abſence) very reſpective of your Grace, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in your own perſon, and affairs. I never received any anſwer from your Grace concerning the Provoſtſhip of <hi>Aeton,</hi> nor was it good manners for me to preſſe for the ſame, becauſe in my Letters I did preſume to name my ſelf. The place is mine to beſtow for this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:111544:61"/>time, and not his Majeſties, nor the Colledges. But I do very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly reſerve the Collation of the ſame, to be diſpoſed as your Grace ſhall pleaſe. Yet this will be a ſufficient anſwer to any former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or any reaſonable Competitor.</p>
               <p>His Majeſtie (as your Grace beſt knoweth) promiſed me at the delivery of the Seal a better Biſhoprick, and intended it certainly, if any ſuch had fallen. My Charge is exceeding great, my Bribes are very little, my Biſhoprick, Deanery, and other <hi>Commendams</hi> do not clear unto me above one thouſand pounds a year at the uppermoſt. It hath pleaſed God, that the caſualties of my office, (which is all the benefit of the ſame, and enriched my Lord <hi>Elſmor,</hi>) hath not been worth to me theſe two years paſt one ſhilling. It may mend when it pleaſeth God.</p>
               <p>I leave all theſe, and my ſelf, who am your Vaſſal, at your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips feet, and do reſt, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>MAy it pleaſe your Grace, I troubled his Highneſſe with a long relation of the <hi>Conſulto</hi> we had about his Majeſties taking of the Oath. Which I had written to your Grace, and not to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but that I was frighted by great men, that I had done his Highneſſe a diſpleaſure in preſſing his Majeſties aſſent unto the ſame. And I proteſt I was ſo poorly accompanied in my opinion, that I was truly afraid I had not done well. And therefore I took occaſion to write my reaſons at large unto the Prince. Which I heard by Sir <hi>John Hipſley</hi> from your Grace was well taken. I humbly thank your Grace, who I know forwarded the ſame. And ſo I perceive by a Letter from his Highneſſe ſo full of ſweetneſſe, as I am overwhelmed.</p>

               <q>That if the King of Spain ſhould make a double marriage with the ſecond Brother of <hi>France,</hi> and his Siſter, and beſtow the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as a Dower upon his ſiſter, in what caſe were we then?</q>
               <p>I anſwered, That we ſhould be then, in no worſe caſe (for ought I knew) then we are now: but that <hi>Germany</hi> might be in a far better caſe. Peradventure it was but a word let fall to terrifie me withal.</p>
               <p>But your Grace may make that uſe of it, as to underſtand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, if your Grace ſhall hear any mention thereof hereafter.

               <p>SInce my coming hither, finding my Lord at good opportunity, I have acquainted him in what perplexity I found your Lordſhip at my coming from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and upon what reaſon. And though I am ſorrie I can make no comfortable relation of his anſwer, yet becauſe it ſo much importeth your Lordſhip to know in what terms you ſtand, I could not conceal it from you, being agreeable to thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports your Lordſhip hath already heard, ſaving that his Grace told me, he doth not ſeek your ruine (as ſome others had related) but onely will hereafter ceaſe to ſtudy your fortune, as formerly he hath done; and withal added the reaſon, that your Lordſhip hath run a courſe oppoſite to him, which though he had cauſe to take ill at your
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:111544:62"/>hands, yet he could have paſſed it over, if it had been out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or affection to his Majeſties ſervice, or the Publique good, but being both dangerous to your countrie, and prejudicial to the cauſe of religion (which your Lordſhip above all other men ſhould have laboured to uphold) he thought, he could not with reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that ſtrictneſſe of friendſhip, where your Lordſhip had made ſuch a ſeparation, eſpecially having divers times out of his love to you, aſſayd to bring you into the right way, which once you promiſed to follow; but the two laſt times you met in Councel, he found, that you took your kue juſt as other men did, and joyned with them in their opinions, whoſe aim was to tax his proceedings in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Princes buſineſſe. But inſtead of laying it upon him, they did no leſſe, then throw dirt in the Princes teeth. For either they would make him a <hi>minor,</hi> or put the refuſal of the Ladie upon his Highneſſe, and to lay an aſperſion upon his carriage there. His Lordſhips Concluſion with me was, that for any carriage of his, he deſireth no other favour, but that the greateſt Councel in England may be judge of it, and the like he wiſheth for other mens actions. Yet I did what I could to perſwade his Grace to expoſtulate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with your Lordſhip, which he told me, he would no more do, having done it already, but found no other ſatisfaction, but that by your practiſe you rejected what he had ſaid, and beſides, divulged what had paſſed between you, as he evidently perceived meeting with it among others. Whereby you gained onely thus much, that they eſteemed of you, as of a man fit, by reaſon of your paſſion, to ſet all on fire, but held you not worthy of truſt, becauſe you, that would not be true to him, would never be ſo to them.</p>
               <p>My Lord, this is a part I would never have choſen, but being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by your Lordſhip, I could do you no better ſervice then faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and plainely to diſcharge it, leaving the uſe to your Lordſhips wiſedom, and ever reſting</p>

               <p>NOt preſuming to write unto your Grace being ſo offended at me, but reſolved with ſorrow, and Patience, to try what I was able to ſuffer, without the leaſt thought of oppoſition againſt your abſolute pleaſure; his Higneſſe hath encouraged, and commanded the contrary, aſſuring me (which I cannot repeat again without teares) that upon his credit, your Grace neither did, nor doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſuch real diſtaſt againſt me, but did onely ſuſpect I had conceived his Highneſſes mind in that full manner, which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe himſelf, is now fully ſatisfied. I did not. In the which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and miſtake of the Prince his reſolution, for want of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with your Grace, or ſome other, I did (as I freely confeſſed) offend his Highneſſe, but not your Grace at all. Being ever reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſtand, or fall (though diverſified in opinion) Your Graces moſt faithful and conſtant ſervant. I humbly therefore beſeech your Grace firſt to receive back this encloſed Letter of Mr. <hi>Packers,</hi> and to burn the ſame, then to receive my ſoule in gage and pawn.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I never harboured in this breaſt one thought of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hurt your Grace from the firſt hour I ſaw your face.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I never conſulted (much leſſe practiſed) with any Lord of that Committee to vote on the one or the other ſide.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I do not know that Lord in England, that hath any deſign againſt your Grace, and when I ſhall know any ſuch, whoſoever it be, I ſhall be his enemy as long as he continueth ſo unto your Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I do not know (nor do I believe,) but that your Grace ſtands as firm in his Majeſties favour, and in his Highneſſe as ever you did in all your life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I never made the leaſt ſhew of ſiding with any oppoſite Lord unto your Grace, and I defie any man, that ſhall avow it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I never divulged your Graces, or the ſecrets of any man.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I do moſt humbly and heartily crave your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pardon, for ſuſpecting (that is the utmoſt of my offence), ſo true, real, and Noble a friend. Yet that I may not appear a very beaſt, give me leave once to remember and ever after to forget, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which drew me ſo to do. And I will do it in the ſame order they came into my head.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your Graces charge upon me at York houſe, that I was a man odious to all the world.</p>

               <p n="3">3. A report of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador, that amongſt others, your Grace intended to ſacrifice me this Parliament to appeaſe the diſlike of immunities exerciſed towards the Catholiques.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your Graces motion unto my ſelf concerning my place (which now I abſolutely know proceeded out of love) at White-hall.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A moſt wicked lie, that one told, he heard your Grace move his Highneſſe to ſpeake unto me to quit my place, after your Graces profeſſions of friendſhip to me.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Mr. Secretarie <hi>Conwaies</hi> and my Lord <hi>Carlile's</hi> eſtrangedneſſe from me, which I ſuſpected could not be (for I ever loved them both) but true copies of your Graces diſpleaſure.</p>

               <p>Although they never transported me a jott further, then to look about how to defend my ſelf, being reſolved (as God ſhall be my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector) to ſuffer all the obloquie of the world, before I would be drawn to the leaſt ingratitude againſt your Grace. All that I beg is an aſſurance of your Graces former Love, and I will plainely profeſſe what I do not in the leaſt beg or deſire from your Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No Patronage of any corrupt or unjuſt act which ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt me this Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No defence of me, if it ſhall appear I betrayed my King, or my Religion in favour of the Papiſt, or did them any real reſpect at all, beſides ordinary complements.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No refuge in any of my cauſes, or clamours againſt me (which upon a falſe ſuppoſal of your Graces diſpleaſure may be many) otherwiſe then according to juſtice, and fair proceeding.</p>
               <p>And let this paper bear record againſt me at the great Parliament of all, if I be not in my heart, and ſoul, your Graces moſt faithful and conſtant poor friend and Servant.</p>
               <p>His Highneſſe deſires your Grace to move his Majeſtie to accept of my Lord <hi>Sayes</hi> commiſſion, and to procure me leave to ſend for him. Alſo to move his Majeſtie that my Lord of <hi>Hartford</hi> may be in the houſe, accepting his fathers place, and making his proteſtation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:111544:64"/>to ſue for his Grandfathers, according to his Majeſties Lawes, when the King ſhall give him leave. His Highneſſe, and my Lords do hold this a modeſt and ſubmiſſive Petition.</p>
               <p>His Highneſſe upon very deep reaſons, doubts whether it be ſafe to put all upon the Parliament, for fear they ſhould fall to examine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſpatches, wherein they cannot but find many Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And would have the propoſition onely to ayd for the recovery of the Palatinate. To draw on an engagement I propound it might be, to adviſe his Majeſtie how this recovery ſhall be effected, by reconquering the ſame, or by a War of diverſion. This will draw on a breach with Spain, without ripping up of private diſpatches. His Highneſſe ſeemed to like well hereof, and commanded me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Grace therewith, and to receive your opinion. I humbly, crave again two lines of aſſurance, that I am in your Grace's opinion as I will ever be indeed, &amp;c.</p>

And then made a complaint againſt the Duke, that he aggravated, and pretended accuſations againſt Spain; whereas its onely offence was, that they refuſed to give unto him equal honour, and obſervance, as they did unto his Highneſſe. And that this was the only cauſe of his hatred againſt them.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he made a long invective, and remonſtrance unto the King, which he had put into writing in Spaniſh, which he read unto me, corrected with the hand of <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> which I do know.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the King was no more a freeman at this time, then King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>France</hi> when he was priſoner in England, or King <hi>Francis</hi> when he was at <hi>Madrid.</hi> Being beſieged and cloſed up with the ſervants and vaſſals of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Embaſſadours knew very well, and were informed 4. moneths ago, that his Majeſtie was to be reſtrained, and confined to his Country houſe, and paſtimes, and the Government of the State to be aſſumed and diſpoſed of by others, and that this was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by <hi>Buckinghams</hi> followers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Duke had reconciled himſelf to all the popular men of the State, and drawn them forth out of priſons, reſtraints, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements to alter the Government of the State at this Parliament, as <hi>Oxford, South-hampton, Say,</hi> and others, whom he met at Suppers and Ordinaries to ſtrengthen his popularity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Duke to breed an opinion of his own greatneſſe, and to make the King grow leſſe, hath oftentimes brag'd openly in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that he had made the King yield to this and that, which was pleaſure unto them. And that he mentioned openly before the Houſes his Majeſties private oath, which the Embaſſadors have never ſpoken of to any creature to this hour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That theſe Kingdomes are not now governed by a Monarch, but by a <hi>Triumviri,</hi> whereof <hi>Buckingham</hi> was the firſt and chiefeſt, the Prince the ſecond, and the King the laſt; and that all look towards <hi>Solem Orientem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. That his Majeſtie ſhould ſhew himſelf to be, as he was reputed, the oldeſt and wiſeſt King in <hi>Europe,</hi> by freeing himſelf from this Captivity, and eminent danger wherein he was, by cutting off ſo dangerous and ungrateful an affecter of greatneſſe and popularity, as the Duke was.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That he deſired his Majeſtie to conceal this his free dealing with him, becauſe it might breed him much peril and danger.

His Majeſtie ſaid, That when his Highneſſe went to Spain, he was as well affected to that Nation as heart could deſire, and as well diſpoſed as any ſon in Europe; but now he was ſtrangely carried away with raſh, and youthful Councels, and followed the humour of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who had he knew not how many Devils within him ſince that journey.</p>

                  <p>HE had heard that the Duke had puſht at me in Parliament, and intended to do ſo again, when he had done with the Treaſurer, and therefore ſhewed, that if I would joyn to ſet upon him with the King, there was a fit occaſion.</p>
                  <p>I anſwered, that the Prince and the Duke had preferred me into my place, and kept me in it, and if I found them purſuing I would not keep it an hour. That what favour ſoever I ſhewed the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, or Catholiques, I did it for their ſakes, and had thanks of them for it. And that I would deal by way of counſel with the Duke to be temperate, and moderate; but to be in oppoſition to my friend, and Patron, I knew he (being one that profeſſed ſo much love unto me) would never expect from an honeſt man.

               <p>I Hold it my duty to give your Grace a preſent account of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent made for Sir <hi>Richard Weſton.</hi> Having put off the ſealing of the ſame as fairly as I could (though not without the clamour of one <hi>Lake,</hi> a ſervant of Mr. <hi>Chancelours,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. William Lake.</note> who very ſaucily preſt for a diſpatch,) this morning, Mr. <hi>Chancelour</hi> ſpake with me himſelf, to whom I made anſwer, That I would ſeal his Patent, according to his Majeſties Warrant, but would retain it in my hands (as I was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:111544:66"/>until I either ſpake with the King, or received his farther Command in that behalf. He told me he would write unto your Grace concerning the ſtay thereof, and the ſtand of the Kings buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, until it were delivered, which courſe (I told him) was very fair. After I acquainted his Highneſſe with my ſealing and retaining of the Patent, and asked him, if he knew thereof. His Highneſſe anſwered, he did know thereof, but gave no approbation of the courſe, and (although he durſt not ſpeak to croſſe it) he hoped I ſhould have directions from the King to pull off the Seals again. Three houres after I went to his Highneſſe the ſecond time, and asked him, if he meant really as he ſpake, or intended onely to make me believe ſo. I deſired to know his mind, leſt I might ſteer my courſe contrary to his intendment. His Highneſſe anſwered, He meant really, and would endeavour to effectuate all that he ſpake. Which I thought very fitting for your Grace to know with all ſpeed.</p>
               <p>But for the man himſelf, I muſt deliver unto your Grace my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For ought I ever ſaw in him he is a very honeſt, and a very ſufficient man, and ſuch a one, as I never in all my life could obſerve to be any way falſe, or unfaithful unto your Grace. He was brought in by your Grace fore againſt my will, (as your Grace may call to mind, what I ſaid to your Grace at Woodſtock to that effect) not that I diſliked the Gentleman, but becauſe I was afraid he would be wholly the Treaſurers, who began then to out-top me, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to my thoughts, likely enough by his daring and boldneſſe, (two virtues very powerful and active upon our Royal Maſter,) in time to do as much to your Grace. From that time to this, I never obſerved in <hi>VVeſton</hi> any unworthineſſe, or ingratitude to your Grace. Nay, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pardon, I will proceed one ſtep farther, I know no fitter man in England for the office, if he come in as a creature of the Prince, and your Grace's; nor unfitter, if he ſhould offer to take it, without your likings. I think your Grace will remember, that this fortnight, this hath been my conſtant opinion.</p>
               <p>Upon the death of one Mr. <hi>Read,</hi> the Secretaries place for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue is void. The Dean of Wincheſter, and I moved the King for <hi>Patrick Young,</hi> the fitteſt man in England for that place. And the Prince did, and will ſecond the motion. I Beſeech your Grace to aſſiſt us, or els the immodeſty of his Competitor (that <hi>Lake</hi> I ſpake of in the beginning of this Letter) will bear down this moſt honeſt, and baſhful creature.</p>

               <p>I beſeech your Grace, that I may receive from the Prince's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and your Grace, ſome directions how to demean my ſelf to the French Embaſſador, in matters concerning Recuſants, and that Mr. Secretary may either addreſſe himſelf to Mr. Atturny General in theſe cauſes, or elſe write unto me plainely what I am to do.</p>

I thought fit to return unto your Grace this account of the meſſage received by your Grace's Steward.</p>
               <p>I ſpake with that Lord, and although he ſeemed to be quite off from the buſineſſe, and had (to my knowledg) diſpoſed of his money for a great, and a fair purchaſe here in <hi>London,</hi> and was reſolved never to touch any more upon <hi>VVatt Steward,</hi> (who had touched ſomewhat of his,) and with whom he had agreed for 4000 <abbr>l.</abbr> yet hearing the propoſition to come ſo intirely from me, as proceeding immediately from your Grace, whoſe good favours this Lord (I proteſt unto your Grace) hath earneſtly deſired, and if at any time he hath ſtraggled aſide from the Prince's deſires, and yours, it was merely and ſolely becauſe he thought he was not ſo much relied upon as others of his rank. He promiſeth me ſometime to morrow a reaſonable anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His material Objections were theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. QUantity of the money; ſo as firſt and laſt he is out 16000 <abbr>l.</abbr> whereas <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> his Countryman and neighbour got up from a Gentleman, for 14000. <abbr>l.</abbr> I anſwered, That I obſerved your Grace never got by any of theſe bargains, but that in this compaſſe of a year or two, your favours exceed any gratuity preſented.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Precedencie before <hi>VVallingford,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Vane.</hi> I did promiſe (for your ſervice) to diſpute the latter, but could ſay nothing to the former, becauſe he was a Viſcount, and his far ancienter Baron.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your Grace's favour, and reflection upon himſelf, (bred up in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:111544:68"/>the experience of war and peace,) and upon his ſons, all of them well bred, but moſt towards the War. I did anſwer generally, that upon his application of himſelf towards your Grace, I made little doubt, but he ſhould receive good ſatisfaction in thoſe expectances.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Times of payment. I told him I knew he would demand but a convenient time therein, and that I knew your Grace would never ſtand upon.</p>
               <p>If I have erred in any of theſe addreſſes, I pray let your Steward come, and reform me therein; as alſo to tell me, whether if I find him coming forward, I may not ſay unto him, That your Lordſhip upon a former motion of mine, was willing upon the next change of the Commiſſion for the Councel of the War, to adde him unto the number.</p>

               <p n="3">3. I know he is a great Gameſter, and of no fitting converſation for a Church-man; but of very mean parts, either of Learning, or government.</p>

               <p>I Humbly beſeech you to interpret favourably, what I ſaid unto his Majeſtie or his Highneſſe, as intending to put off Dr. <hi>Scott</hi> from this place. And no way (God be my witneſſe) to croſſe your Grace, nor to hurt <hi>Scot,</hi> who might have been otherwaies ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for.</p>
               <p>But I ſhould have written or ſpoken unto your Grace? ſo I did in this Letter encloſed, upon <hi>Chriſtmaſſe</hi> Eve. But I confeſſe I durſt not ſend it, for fear of offending your Grace, which I do take all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diligence to avoid.</p>
               <p>But, I ſpake unto the King, and Prince? I did ſo; but with this caution, (which I know they do remember,) that if your Grace would not upon the motion exchange <hi>Scot</hi> to ſome other preferment, I did not hold it fit to preſſe theſe charges againſt him, but would do my endeavour to ſtill and quiet thoſe of the Church of <hi>York,</hi> who (I confeſſe unto your Grace) are the men that have written againſt him.</p>
               <p>But I recommended Dr. <hi>VVhite,</hi> and another to the Prince, and Dr. <hi>VVarner</hi> to your Grace: I confeſſe it, but muſt diſtinguiſh the times, and the manner. I commended D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>VVarner,</hi> when I was informed D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>White</hi> had his anſwer, and denial, and that your Grace was off from Dr. <hi>Scot,</hi> and did deſire to hear from me, what Doctor <hi>Warner</hi> was, whom I recommended onely in general terms upon the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:111544:69"/>ſuit of another. What I ſaid of him, I believe, and know to be true, but he is ſo far from being any creature of mine, that I proteſt before the Almighty God, I never ſpake one word with the man to this very hour in all my life. I did conceive ſo meanly of Doctor <hi>Scot,</hi> that no worthy man in the Kingdom ſhould have failed of my recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this particular.</p>
               <p>Now I know your Grace's reſolution, I do alter my opinion, and humbly crave your Grace's pardon for my meddling therein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know his Highneſſe will bear me witneſſe, it was with all dutiful reſpect unto your Grace. I ſhall be very careful of giving your Grace the leaſt cauſe of jealouſie in this kind again. And whereas I had put a poor ſuit in your Grace's hands about the helping of mypoor fortunes, I will let that, and all others fall, and deſire onely to be accounted</p>

               <p>THis heavy, and unexpected accident of my Lord Stewards death, makes me to be troubleſome unto your Grace at this time. In ſafety and diſcretion, I might very eaſily ſpare this labour: but my obligation to your Grace is ſuch, as if that I conceal any thing, which but my ſelf apprehends fit to be repreſented to your Grace, whileſt I affect the title of a reſerved, cloſe, and wiſe, I may loſe the other of an honeſt man, which I more eſteem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus much by way of preface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I repreſent this office of a Lord Steward, as a place to be either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by your ſelf, or elſe to be diſcontinued (as for many years towards the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the beginning of our Maſters raign it was) and in any caſe, not to be placed upon another, without the deliberation of ſome few years at the leaſt. Being an office, that none but the Kings Kinſmen, or Favorites, or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourites (raiſed up of purpoſe to ballance the great one) have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently poſſeſſed: I could deſire your Grace had it in your own perſon; for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an office of fair, and very competent gettings, but that is ſcarce conſiderable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It keeps you in all changes and alterations of years neer the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:111544:70"/>King, and gives unto you all the opportunities, and acceſſes, without the envie of a favorite. I beſeech your Grace pauſe well upon this, and call to mind, if the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Richmond</hi> was not in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It Gives you opportunities to gratifie all the Court, great and ſmall, <hi>Virtute Officii</hi> in right of your place. Which is a thing better accepted of, and interpreted, then a courteſie from a favorite. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this you are a diſpenſer of your own; but in the other (ſay many envious men,) of the Kings goodneſſe, which would flow faſt enough of it ſelf, but that it is reſtrained to this Pipe and channel onely.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There muſt be one day an end of this attendance as a Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man, but I hope never of being next unto the King, as a great Counceller, and officer, and above all others, which you cannot be, but by this office. The Maſter of the horſe is but a Knights place at the moſt, and the Admirals (in time of action) either to be imployed abroad Perſonallie, or to live at home in that ignominie, and ſhame, as your Grace will never endure to do ſo.</p>
               <p>I will trouble your Grace with a tale of <hi>Dante</hi> the firſt Italian Poet of note. Who being a great, and wealthie man in <hi>Florence,</hi> and his opinion demanded, who ſhould be ſent Embaſſador to the Pope, made this anſwer, that he knew not who <hi>Si jo vo chiſta, Si jo ſto chi va.</hi> If I go, I know not who ſhall ſtay at home; if I ſtay, I know not who can perform this imployment. Yet your Grace ſtaying at home in favour, and greatneſſe with his Majeſtie, may by your deſigns and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections ſo diſpoſe of the Admiral, as to injoy the glory, without running the hazard of his perſonal imployment. My Gracious Lord, if any man ſhall put you in hope, that the Admiralty will fill your Coffers, and make you rich, call upon them to name one Admiral that ever was ſo. As in time of hoſtility there is ſome getting, ſo are there hungry and inſatiable people preſently to devoure the ſame. God made man to live upon the land, and neceſſity onely drives him to Sea. Yet is not my advice abſolutely for your relinquiſhing of this, but in any caſe for the retaining of the other place though with the loſſe of the Admiraltie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I beſeech your Grace obſerve the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> (who being the onely favorite in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> time, that was of any conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance) made choice of this place onely, and refuſed the Admiralty two ſeveral times, as being an occaſion, either to withdraw him from the Court, or to leave him there, laden with ignominie. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord Steward, wiſe, and in favour, he wholly commanded the Admiralty, and made it miniſterial, and ſubordinary to his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:111544:70"/>
               <p n="6">6. Remember, that this office is fit for a young, a middle, and an old man to injoy, and ſo is not any other that I know about his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Now God almighty having given you favour at the firſt, and ſince a great quantity (I never flattered your Grace, nor do now) of wit, and wiſe experience, I would humbly recommend unto your Grace this opportunity to be neereſt unto the King in your young, your middle, and your decreaſing age, that is to be on earth, as your piety will one day make you in heaven, an everlaſting favorite. There are many objections, which your Grace may make, but if I find any inclination in your Grace to lay hold upon this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I dare undertake to anſwer them all. Your Grace may leave any office you pleaſe (if your Grace be more in love with the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie, then I think you have cauſe,) to avoid envie. But my final concluſion is this, to deſire your Grace moſt humbly to put no other Lord into this office, without juſt, and mature deliberation. And to pardon this boldneſſe, and haſte, which makes me to write ſo weakly in a theame, that I perſwade my ſelf I could maintaine very valiantly; I have no other copie of this Letter, and I pray God your Grace be able to read this. I ſend your Grace a Letter delivered unto me from <hi>Conde Gondomar,</hi> and dated either at <hi>Madrid,</hi> or (as I obſerve it was written firſt,) at London. There is no great matter at whither of the places it was invented. I humbly beſeech your Grace to ſend by this bearer the reſolution for the Parliament. And do reſt</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Robert Howard</hi> appeared yeſterdy, and continues obſtinate in his refuſal to ſwear. When we came to examin the commiſſion for our power to fine him for this obſtinacie, we found that Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook,</hi> (foreſeeing out of a prophetical, how near it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a Grandchild of his own day) hath expunged this clauſe (by the help of the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Salisburie,</hi>) out of the commiſſion, and left us nothing but the ruſtie ſword of the church, excommunication, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the authority of this Court. We have given him day until Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdy next, either to conform, or to be excommunicated. She hath
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:111544:71"/>anſwered wittilie, and cunningly, but yet ſufficient for the Coniſance of the Court. Confeſſeth a fame of incontinencie againſt her, and <hi>Howard,</hi> but ſayeth it was raiſed by her Husbands kindred. I do not doubt but the buſineſſe will go on well, but (peradventure) more ſlowly, if <hi>Howard</hi> continue refractory, for want of this power to fine, and amerce him. I beſeech your Grace, either to procure me the favour to come, or to excuſe my not ſeeing his Majeſtie in this time of his indiſpoſition, which I hear ſtill continueth. I beſeech Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God (as in eternal duty I am bound) preſently to eaſe him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to his perfect health Mr. <hi>Packers</hi> being away makes me unmannerly. I am humbly to deſire your Grace to be pleaſed to move his Majeſtie (at your firſt opportunity) to ſign this Commiſſion, for the proroguing of the Parliament, and to read unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie this paper of names here incloſed, (which his Majeſtie is not to ſign,) knowing his pleaſure, whether he alloweth of them for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for the laſt ſubſide of the Lords.

               <p>FOr your Brothers buſineſſe, this is all I have to acquaint your Grace with. Sir <hi>Robert Howard</hi> appeared yeſterday at Lambeth, pretended want of Councel, (the Doctors being out of town) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired reſpite until to morrow, and had it granted by my Lords Grace. Moſt men think he will not take his oath at all; I do incline to the contrary opinion, becauſe (to my knowledge) he hath ſent far, and near for the moſt able Doctors in the Kingdom to be feed for him, which were great follie if he intended not to anſwer. He is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended for his cloſeneſſe and ſecreſie by the major part of our auditors, (the Hee and Shee good fellowes of the town,) and though he refuſeth to be a Confeſſor, yet is ſure to die a Martyr, and moſt of the Ladies in town will offer at his ſhryne. The Lady <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſome nine dayes ſince, was at Stoke, with the good Knight her Husband for ſome counſel in this particular. But he refuſed to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle therewithal, and diſmiſt her Ladiſhip, when ſhe had ſtayed with him very lovingly half a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of my troubling your Grace is this. The French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:111544:71"/>is fired with ſome complaints of our Recuſants, who (I verily believe) work upon him purpoſely, finding him to be of a combuſtible diſpoſition. To morrow he is reſolved to come upon you, and our Maſter with Complaints, for lack of performances to the Papiſts. And becauſe I would furniſh your Grace with as much anſwer, as I am acquainted with, (nothing doubting but your Grace is otherwaies better provided,) I make bold to preſent your Grace with theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With a Letter from my Lord Archbiſhop of York in anſwer to another of mine; which ſhews how really his Majeſties promiſe hath been in that kind performed. I beſeech your Grace to keep it ſafe in your pocket, until I ſhall have the honour to wait upon your Grace, when you have made uſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If your Grace ſhall hear him complain of the Judges in their charges, and of their receiving of Indictments; your Grace may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That thoſe charges are but orations of Courſe, opening all the penal Lawes, and the Indictments being preſented by the Country, cannot be refuſed by the Judges. But the Judges are ordered to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute nothing actually againſt the Recuſants, nor will they do it, during the negotiation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your Grace may put him in mind, that my Lord Keeper doth every day, when his, (the Lord Embaſſadours) Secretary calls upon him, grant forth Writs to remove all the perſons indicted in the Country into the Kings Bench, out of the power and reaches of the Juſtices of the Peace. And that being there, the King may, and doth releaſe them at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Spaniſh Embaſſadour never had, nor deſired more then theſe favours.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That you are informed, that Copies of Letters written from the King to both the Archbiſhops are ſpread abroad in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> to his Majeſties diſadvantage (for ſo it is) and that thereby my Lord Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour may perceive the bent of the Engliſh Catholiques, which is not to procure eaſe and quietneſſe to themſelves, but Scandals to their neighbouring Proteſtants, and diſcontentments againſt the King and State.</p>
               <p>I humbly crave your Graces pardon for this boldneſſe, and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and with my hearty prayers for your health, do reſt</p>

               <p>I Send your Grace here incloſed, the Kings Commiſſion, and the Prince's Proxie, not fairly written, (which the Embaſſadours upon the place may procure in a frech hand,) but yet legibly, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably. The Prince's Proxie refers the manner unto the articles, and particularly to the ſecond, third, and fourth Section of thoſe Articles; which gives me occaſion to begg of your Grace pardon, to deſire your Grace to think ſeriouſly upon the third Section, to adviſe with the Prince, and to give Mr. <hi>Packer</hi> charge to inform your Grace punctually what he knoweth, and may inform himſelf concerning thoſe particulars. That is, How the Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> of France was married to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and how Madam his ſiſter was married to the Prince of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> For although they are both made alike in the article, yet ſurely they were not married after the ſame faſhion. For the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Barr</hi> was married in a cloſet, without a Maſſe, by words onely of the Preſent tenſe, as I believe, I have read in the Hiſtorie of <hi>Thuanus.</hi> A favour, which will hardly be granted to your Grace. And how Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> was married, my Lords the Embaſſadours will ſoon learn, if your Grace will be pleaſed to write unto them.</p>
               <p>I hold it (in a manner) neceſſary, that your Grace do carrie over with you in your company one Civilian to put your Grace in mind of the formalities required; and if your Grace be of that mind, your own Doctor, Dr. <hi>Reeves</hi> is as fit as any man elſe, who is a good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and ſpeaks that language. Your Grace hath revived my Lord of <hi>Clare,</hi> ſithence I ſpake with your Grace. And I beſeech your Grace to follow that reſolution, and to let Mr. <hi>Packer</hi> draw up a warrant of 3. or 4. lines ſigned by the King to me to place him with the reſt of the Councel of War. It will be an occaſion to take up more of that time, which he now ſpends with the Lady <hi>Hatton.</hi> For now I am reſolved, that I was of the right in my conjecture to your Grace, that his Lordſhip had utterly refuſed my Lady <hi>Purbecks</hi> cauſe (of the which the very common people begin to be aſhamed) but is deeply ingaged againſt my Lady of <hi>Richmond,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dutcheſſe of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
                  </note> in the buſineſſe of that famous (or rather notorious) foeminine Contract, and bargain, of ſixteen hundred pounds by the year for a houſe to ſleep in.</p>
               <p>When your Grace ſhall draw up your Inſtructions, you will be pleaſed to uſe the words, To Contract, Eſpouſe and marrie Our Welbeloved Son, &amp;c. becauſe they do in thoſe parts contract alwaies
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:111544:72"/>before marriage. And your Grace will be pleaſed to expreſſe his Majeſties pleaſure, that this is to be done by your ſelf, and no other: Becauſe although the two Earls upon the place, have ſome ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral words in their Commiſſion, yet your Grace only is named in the Prince's Proxie, and now ſolely imployed by the King to that purpoſe. Although I conceived this reſtraint to be fitter a great deal for the inſtructions, then the Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>I am extream ſorry to hear what a grievous fit his Majeſtie had this laſt night. But I hope it is a farewel of the Agues, and I pray God it be the laſt fit. And now am an humble ſuitor again, that I may come and look upon his Majeſtie, reſolved to ſay nothing, but that which I will never ceaſe to ſay, God bleſſe him.

               <p>Theſe two particulars I preſent with all ſubmiſſion unto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and ſhall reſt ſatisfied with what royal reſolution your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſhall make therein.</p>
               <p>Theſe petitions that follow I muſt earneſtly beg at your Majeſties
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:111544:73"/>hands, and for Gods ſake, and your bleſſed Fathers ſake, whoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and moſt painful ſervant I was.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that your Majeſtie would be pleaſed to mitigate, and allay the cauſeleſſe diſpleaſure of my Lord Duke againſt me; who is ſo little ſatisfied with any thing I can do, or ſuffer, that I have no means left to appeaſe his anger, but my prayers to God, and your Sacred Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I beſeech your Majeſtie for Chriſt Jeſus ſake not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve newes, or accuſations againſt me concerning my carriage paſt, preſent, or to come, whileſt I ſtand thus injoyned from your Royal preſence, before you ſhall have heard my anſwer, and defence unto the particulars. Thoſe that inform your Majeſtie may (God he knoweth) be oftentimes mis-informed.</p>
               <p>My laſt ſupplication unto your Majeſtie is, That in my abſence this Parliament, no uſe may be made of your ſacred name to wound the reputation of a poor Biſhop, who beſides his Religion and Dutie to that Divine Character you now bear, hath ever affectionately honoured your very Perſon above all the objects in this world, as he deſires the ſalvation of the world to come. But I crave no protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt any other accuſer, or accuſation whatſoever. So ſhall I never ceaſe to pray to the Almighty God to make your Majeſtie the Happieſt and Greateſt King, that ever was Crowned, and Anointed: which ſhall be the continual oriſons of</p>

               <p>I Owe more ſervice to that true love, and former acquaintance, which your Lordſhip hath been pleaſed to afford me, now theſe full ten yeares, then to be ſparing, or reſerved in ſatisfying your Lordſhip about any doubt whatſoever, the reſolution whereof ſhall lie in my power. Concerning that offence, taken by many people, both on this ſide the borders and in Scotland, from that Clemencie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:111544:74"/>which his Majeſtie was pleaſed to extend to the impriſoned Lay-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants of this Kingdom, and my Letter written unto the Juſtices for the reigling of the ſame, which your Lordſhip did intimate unto me yeſterday at Mr. <hi>Henry Gibbs</hi> his houſe, out of ſome newes received from a Peer of Scotland. This is the plaineſt return I can make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Lordſhip. In the general, as the Sun in the firmament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears unto us no bigger then a Platter, and the Stars but as ſo many nails in the pummel of a ſaddle, becauſe of the Elongement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between our eyes, and the object; ſo is there ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable diſtance betwixt the deep reſolution of a Prince, and the ſhallow apprehenſion of common and ordinary people, that as they will be ever judging and cenſuring, ſo muſt they be obnoxious to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and miſtaking.</p>
               <p>Particularly, for as much as concerns my ſelf, I muſt leave my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, my profeſſion, my continuall preaching, my writing, (which is inſtant in the hands of many,) my private indeavours about ſome great perſons, and the whole bent of my actions, (which in the place I live in cannot be concealed, to teſtifie unto the world, what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I am likely to importune for the Papiſts in their religion. For the King my Maſter, I will tell you a ſtorie out of <hi>Velleius Paterculus.</hi> A Surveyor bragging to M. <hi>Livius Druſus,</hi> that he would ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive his houſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Libera à conſpectu immunis ab omnibus arbitris eſſet,</hi> that it ſhould ſtand removed out of ſight, and be paſt all danger of peeping, or Eves-dropping; was anſwered again by <hi>Druſus, Tu vero, ſi quid in te artis eſt ita compone domum mean, ut quicquid agam ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Conſpici poſſit,</hi> Nay my good friend, if you have any devices in your head, contrive my houſe after ſuch a manner, that all the world may ſee what I do therein. So if I ſhould indeavour to flouriſh up ſome artificial Vault, to hide and conceal the intentions of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, I know I ſhould receive the ſame thanks, that the Surveyor did from <hi>Druſus.</hi> I was not called to Councel by his royal Majeſtie, when the reſolution of this Clemencie to the Lay-Recuſants was firſt concluded: But if I had been asked my opinion, I ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed it without the leaſt haeſitation. His Majeſtie was ſo Popiſhly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted at this time, that (to the incredible exhauſtments of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie) he was a moſt zealous interceder for ſome eaſe and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the Proteſtants in Europe, his own Dominions, and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks onely excepted.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Swithland</hi> (having lately provoked the <hi>Pole</hi>) had no other hope of peace; thoſe of France of the exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; thoſe of the Palatinate, and adjoyning Countries of the leaſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:111544:74"/>connivencie to ſay their prayers, then by the earneſt mediation of our gracious Maſter. And adviſed by the late Aſſembly of Parliament to inſiſt a while longer in this milkie way of interceſſion, and Treatie. What a prepoſterous argument would this have been to deſire thoſe mighty Princes (armed, and victorious) to grant ſome liberty, and clemencie to the Proteſtants, becauſe himſelf did now impriſon, and execute the rigour of his lawes againſt the Roman Catholiques. I muſt deal plainely with your Lordſhip. Our viperous countrymen the Engliſh Jeſuits in France to fruſtrate theſe Pious endeavours of his Majeſties, had many months before this favour granted, retorted that argument upon us, by writing a moſt malitious book (which I have ſeen, and read over) to the French King, inciting him, and the three Eſtates, to put all thoſe ſtatutes in execution againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in thoſe parts, which are here enacted, and (as they falſely informed) ſeverally executed upon the Papiſts. I would therefore ſee the moſt ſubtile State-monger in the world chalk out a way for his Majeſtie to mediate for Grace, and favour for the Proteſtants, by executing at this time the ſeverity of the Lawes upon the Papiſts. And that this favour ſhould mount to a Toleration, is a moſt dull, (and yet a moſt diveliſh) miſconſtruction.</p>
               <p>A Toleration looks forward, to the time to come: This favour backward onely, to the offences paſt. If any Papiſt now ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſhall offend the lawes again, the Juſtices may, (nay muſt) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commit him, and leave favour and mercy to the King, to whom one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it properly belongeth. Nay let thoſe 2. writs directed to the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, be as diligently peruſed by thoſe raſh Cenſures as they were by thoſe grave, and learned, to whom his Majeſtie referred the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the, ſame and they ſhall find, that theſe Papiſts are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwiſe out of priſon, then with their ſhackles about their heels, ſufficient ſureties, and good recogniſances to preſent themſelves again at the next aſſiſes. As therefore that Lacedemonian poſed the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> by asking his opinion of the bird which he graſped in his hand, whether he were alive, or dead, ſo it is a matter yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſed, and undecided, whether thoſe Papiſts (cloſed up, and graſped in the hands of the law) be ſtill in priſon, or at libertie. Their own demeanours, and the ſucceſſe of his Majeſties negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are Oracles that muſt deſide the ſame. If the Lay-papiſts do wax inſolent with this mercy, inſulting upon the Proteſtants, and tranſlating this favour from the perſon to the cauſe, I am verily of opinion his Majeſtie will remand them to their former ſtate, and condition, and renew his writ no more. But if they ſhall uſe theſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:111544:75"/>graces modeſtly, by admitting Conference with learned Preachers, demeaning themſelves neighbourly and peaceably, praying for his Majeſtie, and the proſperous ſucceſſe of his pious endeavours, and relieving him bountifully (which they are as well able to do as any of his Subjects,) if he ſhall be forced and conſtrained to take his ſword in hand, then it cannot be denied, but our Maſter is a Prince, that hath (as one ſaid) <hi>plus humanitatis penè quam hominis,</hi> and will at that time leave to be merciful, when he leaves to be himſelf. In the mean while, this argument fetcht from the Devils topicks, which concludes a <hi>Concreto ad abſtractum</hi> from a favour done to the Engliſh Papiſts, that the King favoureth the Romiſh Religion is ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of follie, and malice, as is little deſerved by that gracious Prince, who by word, writing, exerciſe of Religion, acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, late directions for catechizing, and preaching, and all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and endeavours in the world hath demonſtrated himſelf ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved a Proteſtant. God by his holy Spirit open the eyes of the people, that theſe aierie repreſentations of ungrounded fancies ſet aſide, they may clearly diſcern, and ſee how by the goodneſſe of God, and the wiſdom of their King, this Iſland of all the Countries in Europe is the ſole neſt of peace and true Religion, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof unhappie onely in this one thing, that they never look up to heaven to give God thanks for ſo great a happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for mine own Letter to the Judges, (which did onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, not operate the favour,) it was either much miſ-penned, or much miſconſtrued. It recited four kinds of recuſancies onely capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his Majeſties clemencie not ſo much to include theſe, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude many other crimes bearing amongſt the Papiſts the name of Recuſancies, as uſing the function of a Romiſh Prieſt, ſeducing the Kings liege people from the Religion eſtabliſhed, ſcandalizing and aſperſing our King, Church, State, or preſent Government. All which offences (being outward practiſes, and no ſecret motions of the conſcience,) are adjudged by the Lawes of England to be merely civil, and political, and excluded by my Letter from the benefit of thoſe Writs, which the bearer was imployed to deliver unto the Judges.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given your Lordſhip a plain account of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of this buſineſſe, and that the more ſuddenly, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might perceive it is not <hi>Aurea Fabula,</hi> or prepared tale, but a bare Narration, which I have ſent unto your Lordſhip. I beſeech your Lordſhip to let his Majeſtie know, that the Letters to the Juſtices of Peace concerning thoſe four heads recommended by his Majeſtie,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:111544:75"/>ſhall be ſent away as faſt as they can be exſcribed. I will trouble your Lordſhip no more at this time, but ſhall reſt ever</p>

Some of them ſuch as are fit onely for Schooles, and to be left at more liberty for learned men to abound in their own ſenſe, ſo they keep themſelves peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and diſtract not the Church. And therefore to make any man ſubſcribe to Schoole opinions, may juſtly ſeeme hard in the Church of Chriſt, and was one great fault of the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> And to affright them from thoſe opinions in which they have (as they are bound) ſubſcribed to the Church, as it is worſe in it ſelf, ſo it may be the Mother of greater danger.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:111544:78"/>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace farther to conſider, that when the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie ſubmited themſelves in the time of Henry the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. the ſubmiſſion was ſo, that if any difference doctrinal, or other fell in the Church, the King and the Biſhops were to be Judges of it in a national Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, or Convocation, The King firſt giving leave under his broad Seale, to handle the points in difference.</p>
               <p>But the Church never ſubmitted to any other Judge, neither indeed can Shee, though Shee would. And we humbly deſire your Grace to conſider, and then to move his moſt Gracious Majeſtie (if you ſhall think fit) what dangerous Conſequences may follow upon it. For firſt, if any other Judge be allowed in matter of Doctrine, we ſhall depart from the ordinance of Chriſt, and the continual courſe and practiſe of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, if the Church, be once brought down beneath her ſelf, we cannot but fear what may be next Strook at.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it will ſome way touch the honour of his majeſties dear Father, and our moſt dread Soveraign of Glorious, and ever bleſſed memorie, King <hi>James,</hi> who ſaw and approved all the opinions in this Book, and he in his rare wiſdom and judgment would never have allowed them, if they had Croſſed with truth and the Church of England.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, we muſt be bold to ſay, that we cannot conceive what uſe there can be of Civil Government in the common Wealth, or of preaching, and external miniſtrie in the Church, if ſuch fatall opinions as ſome which are oppoſite, and contrarie to theſe delivered by Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> are, ſhall be Publiquely taught and maintained.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fiftly, we are certain, that all or moſt of the contrarie opinions were treated of at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and ready to be publiſhed, but then Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memorie, upon notice given, how little they agreed with the Practice of pietie, and obedience to all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cauſed them to be ſuppreſſed, and ſo they have continued ever ſince, till of late ſome of them have received countenance at the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Dort.</hi> Now this was a Synod of that nation, and can be of no authority in any other National Church, till it be received there by Publique authority. And our hope is that the Church of England will be well adviſed, and more then once over, before Shee admit a forraign Synod, eſpeciallie of ſuch a Church as condemneth her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline and manner of Government, to ſay no more.</p>
               <p>And further we are bold to commend to your Graces wiſdom this one particular. His Majeſtie (as we have been informed) hath already taken this buſineſſe into his own care, and moſt worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:111544:79"/>it in a right courſe to Church-conſideration. And we well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that without further trouble to the ſtate, or breach of unity in the Church it might ſo have been well, and orderly compoſed, as we ſtill pray it may, Theſe things conſidered we have little to ſay for Mr. <hi>Mountagues</hi> perſon: onely thus much we know. He is a very good Scholler and a right honeſt man. A man every way able to do God, his Majeſtie, and the Church of England great ſervice. We fear he may receive great diſcouragement, and which is far worſe, we have ſome cauſe to doubt this may bred a great backwardneſſe in able men to write in the defence of the Church of England againſt either home, or forraign adverſaries, if they ſhall ſee him ſink in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes reputation, or health upon his book occaſion.</p>
               <p>And this we moſt humbly ſubmit to your Graces judgment, and care of the Churches peace, and welfare. So recommending your Grace to the protection of Almighty God,</p>

               <p>IN the great Library of men, that I have ſtudied theſe many yeares, your Grace is the beſt Book, and moſt Claſſick authour that I have read, in whom I find ſo much goodneſſe, ſweetneſſe, and nobleneſſe of nature, ſuch an Heroick ſpirit, for boundleſſe bounty as I never did in any. I could inſtance in many, ſome of whom you have made Deanes, ſome Biſhops, ſome Lords, and Privy Councellours. None that ever looked toward your Grace did ever go empty away I, need go no farther then my ſelf (a gum of the Earth) whom ſome 8. years ago you raiſed out of the duſt, for rayſing but a thought ſo high as to ſerve your Highneſſe. Since that, I have not played the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, but more diligently ſtudied you then ever before. And yet (Dunce that I am) I ſtand at a ſtay, and am a <hi>Non-proficient,</hi> the book being the ſame that ever it was, as may appear by the great profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of others. This wonderfully poſeth me, and ſure there is ſome
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:111544:79"/>guile, ſome wile in ſome of my fellow Students, who hide my book from me, or ſome part of it. All the fault is not in mine own block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſſe, that I thrive no better. I once feared this before, that ſome did me ill offices. Your Grace was pleaſed to proteſt no man had, and to aſſure me no man could. My heart tels me, it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies upright, and is ſtill moſt faithful unto you. I have examined my actions, my words, and my very thoughts, and found all of them ever ſince moſt ſound unto your Grace. Give me leave after ſo long Patience (for which vertue you were once pleaſed to commend me to my old Maſter King <hi>James,</hi> and I have not yet loſt it) now that for theſe 12 Months almoſt, I have been not onely upon the Stage, but upon the rack of expectations, even diſtracted between hope and fear, to comfort my ſelf with recordation of your Loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of old, when on that great feaſt day of your being inaugured our Chancellour, my look was your booke, wherein you read ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to which I was bold to anſwer, I truſted your Grace would give me no cauſe. You replyed with (loſſe of blood rather,) that was your noble expreſſion. But God forbid ſo precious an effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. (I would emptie all my veins rather then you ſhould bleed one drop) when as one blaſt of your breath is able to bring me to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where I would be. My Lord I am grown an old man and am like old Houſehouldſtuffe, apt to be broke upon often removing. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it therefore but once for all, be it Eli, or Bathe and Wells, and I will ſpend the remainder of my dayes in writing an Hiſtory of your good deeds to me and others, whereby I may vindicate you from the envie, and obloquy of this preſent wicked age wherein we live, and whileſt I live in praying for your Grace,</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:111544:80"/>Lord for protecting his innocencie: and it came ſeaſonable, like a ſhowr of rain in the time of drouth. My very heart was parched with grief till it came, and it had ere this been broken, had not your Lordſhips ſpeech then dropt comfort, in ſtrength whereof it yet lives. For an abortive thought, which never came into act, ſome 2. or 3. years ago conceived, and that tending to a work of mercy, and charitie, a deed of juſtice, and due thankfulneſſe, how far? how foulie have I been traduced? your Honour cannot imagine how deeply I have been wounded in my good name, as if I had deſerved deprivation, degradation, yea to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. This can none cure but God, or the King, <hi>Deus in monte,</hi> God hath done his part in providing an occaſion. Beſides <hi>London</hi> (which is too high for me to look after) and the removes which may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>Hereford</hi> the next Seat to mine, (whither my Predeceſſors have oft been removed) is ſaid to be now void. Now good my Lord, ſpeak once more ſeaſonably. It is a doubled, and redoubled, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely multiplied benefit, which is ſo given. Never had I more need of the Cordial his Majeſtie gave me at my going into <hi>Wales,</hi> which was that I ſhould not ſtay long there. It would be a reſtorative too, not onely of my Credit, ſo cruelly crackt with the ſharp teeth of the wide mouth of vulgar lying fame, but of my eſtate alſo, alwaies poor, but lately much more impoveriſhed, and made crazie by occaſions of the Church, which drew me to <hi>London</hi> (a place of great expences, as the buſie times were) to little purpoſe: And the Parliament over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking me, which have held me long, and longer yet are like to hold me here, even to the undoing of my ſelf, my wife and ſix children, from whom I have now lived 6. or 7. moneths.

               <p>AT the firſt minute of mine, and my wives delivery out of the Tower, I had returned ſuch acknowledgment due for ſo great a favour, but that Sir <hi>George Goring</hi> only deſired to be the Meſſenger, as well as he was of the other, Let not (my Lord) my late misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes make me or mine more unable to ſerve, and thank you, then any hee, that thus takes advantage thereby to wrong me in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: for what I have both received in abatement of my fine, and ſpeedy libertie, I muſt confeſſe to come from your Noble mediation to his Majeſtie, whoſe diſpleaſure hath been more grievous to my ſoul, then all the reſt this world can inflict upon me.</p>
               <p>As your Lordſhips kindneſſe hath begun to eaſe me, ſo now let the ſame hand cure, and preſerve me from a worſe relapſe wherein I am like to fall, if your power prevent it not. The motion of his Majeſties for my perſwading my ſons out of their places, was the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſeſt ſound that ever entred me, for thereby I ſtill breathed under the heavy weight of all my afflictions, not deſpairing but their Care (charged upon them with my bleſſing) might ſomewhat redeem my errours, and aſſure his Majeſtie, that my will was never tainted with offending him.</p>
               <p>I know my Lord, there is little benefit in ſerving againſt Maſters minds, but they are unworthy ſervants that will leave ſuch Maſters
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:111544:82"/>upon any conditions. Such as make ſuit to chop or change for their own advantage, are better loſt then kept: But as for mine, my curſe ſhould follow them, if ever I could think, they followed his Majeſtie with ſuch indifferencie. My obedience to his Majeſtie was ever of more force with me, then mine own ends any way layed, nor ever joyed I more then in running to his Commands. But this (my Lord) rends my heart to think, that, unfortunate I, ſhould bury my ſons alive, and pronounce that ſentence, which would make me and them Scorns to poſteritie. Whileſt I have knee to bend, eye to lift up, or tongue to begg, I muſt implore his Majeſties pardon, and mercy in this kind. As for that more droſſie part of my eſtate, it ſtill lies at his Majeſties feet, and if he now pleaſe to recal, what he remitted, without further condition, I muſt obey, and let his Majeſtie ſee, no change of time or place can change me, my love, my dutie, or my zeal to him.</p>
               <p>My Lord, here you may read me in my greateſt griefs that ever did fall to me: weigh them well, and think that one day you may be a father, and be as neerly touched, as now I am. The favour you ſhall do me herein ſhall prove no hidden talent, for the increaſe ſhall not onely be the happineſſe of a good work well done, but the hearty acknowledgment of a whole family, and all theirs, that ſhall as faithfully ſerve and honour you, as the beſt of thoſe, that would ſucceed them, which I hope your Lordſhip will believe from me, who will ever be</p>

               <p>Your Princely favour in dilivering me, and my wife out of the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, muſt, and ſhall ever be acknowledged of us with all humble thanks. And now be pleaſed to give me leave to be an humble ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to your Majeſtie, that out of the tender compaſſion of your Princely heart, you will be pleaſed to caſt your eye upon the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of your diſtreſſed, afflicted, and old Servant, now brought into fear of never recovering of your Majeſties favour, and ſo wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my caſe is, as the little hope, that remained in me to live in your
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:111544:82"/>memorie, was by my two ſons ſervice to your Gracious ſelf, and the Prince. It is now required of me to impoſe upon them the reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their places, which with all humility I beſeech you to give me leave to ſay, I would ſooner uſe my power over them to will them to burie themſelves quick, then by any other way then enforcement to give up their places of ſervice, which onely remaines to me to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my dying comfort, or my living torment.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they are now paſt my government, being both married, and have children, onely I have a Paternal Care of them, which I humbly beſeech your beſt judging Majeſtie to weigh reſpectively, how unhappie I muſt of neceſſity think my ſelf, if I ſhould be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader of that misfortune to my children, that their children within a few years would curſe me for, either living, or dead. Upon all theſe juſt conſiderations (moſt Gracious Maſter) give me leave to turn my cruel, &amp;. unnatural part of perſwading them to yield to that, for which I ſhould deteſt my ſelf, to my humbleſt deſire upon the Knees of my heart to beg humbly of your Majeſtie, that whatſoever favour you have ever had to me for any ſervice done, that your Majeſtie will be pleaſed to ſpare the ruine of theſe two young men, whom I find ſo honeſtlie diſpoſed in their deſire of ſpending their fortunes, and lives in your Majeſties, and your Princely ſon's ſervice, as if your diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be not fullie ſatisfyed with what I have ſuffered already, that you lay more upon me, and ſpare them.

Sithence his cauſe was heard, he moved all that heard it with much compaſſion to him, and the people did think, that when you ſent him to the Tower, you would have ſent for him to have kiſſed your hand. But your Majeſtie is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for they do not let you know, what is thought of the proceeding againſt this good man, knowing how truely he loveth you, with the truth of his cauſe, that you would not follow him, and his children with crueltie.
<note place="margin">Which might have been better ſpent.</note> My Lord hath ſpent in running a Tylt, in Maſques, and following the Court above 20000.

               <p>EVer ſince your Lordſhips firſt recommendation of my husband to me, I have thought my ſelf much ingaged to your Lordſhip; for I muſt confeſſe after he had taken his leave of me, I did love him never the leſſe: for immediately after my fathers death (when in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:111544:83"/>my Conſcience he leaſt expected to hear from me) I did both ſend and write to him, which he might interpret an incouragement, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an invitation. I did it the rather, becauſe I did not believe thoſe which did him ill offices; for thoſe which were moſt for him, on a ſudden were moſt againſt him. I muſt confeſſe, that pitie did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm my affection, and I truſt your Lordſhip will commiſerate his eſtate, as you do the fall of all mankind, for I was the <hi>Eva,</hi> and he was the <hi>Adam:</hi> and I pray God the King and your Lordſhip may forgive us, as I am confident God will pardon us. Your Lordſhip may imagine my Mother was of the plot, but I take God to witneſſe, that ſhe was not only againſt it, but contrarily. I did believe ſhe was wholly for your Brother: And for your Brother, my Mother recommended him to me, whom I uſed like a Gentleman of high worth and qualitie. But I did by no means abuſe him by promiſe, or taking guifts, which I falſely ſuffer for, in the opinion of the world. I only took a ring by my mothers appointment, which came as a token from my Lady your mother, which was of very ſmall value. My husband and I am reſolved rather to ſuffer in the opinion of the world, then contradict any thing which ſhall be aggravated againſt us. We muſt both honour you, and think our ſelves much ingaged to your Lordſhip. After God, I proteſt you are the onely authour of it: for by your means, I firſt ſettled my affection. I know there are thoſe which do my husband and me ill offices. I have reaſon to be jealous of the Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> for he would have put tricks upon me in making me deny the Contract; and when he failed in that, he went about to make me believe Mr. <hi>Wray</hi> had denied his. And to tell your Lordſhip true, his violence and over-earneſtneſſe made me the more averſe. If my husband had not fetched me, I would have come to him, and ſo I ſent him word.</p>
               <p>Thus humbly beſeeching your Lordſhip as you are happie in your wife, that you would be pleaſed to make our peace with the King; and ſeeing it is Gods act, that you would honour us with your favour. We ſhall be both bound to joyn in prayer, that you may be ever happie in your Wife, and in your Childrens Children. And ſo with my humble reſpect to your Lordſhip, I reſt</p>

               <p>HOw much my affection and ambition hath been to ſerve your Lordſhip before other men, I hope I ſhall not need now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, conſidering it hath been clear and manifeſt to your own trial, whereof I do bear ſtill the teſtimonie, and the continuance in mine own heart. But in your nobleneſſe it will not appear impertinent to your Lordſhip, that I put you in mind, how much I ſuffered in the diſgrace my enemies caſt upon me about the imployment for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, when I was under your protection; whether I ſuffered for mine own ſake, or for your Lordſhip, I know not: howſoever of this I am aſſured, the greateſt cauſe I gave them, that had leaſt reaſon, was becauſe I ſought not them, but your Lordſhip only. And for the ſucceſſe, you may ſee by the miracles the imployment hath brought forth, that it was carried another way, rather for private ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, then for any great zeal to the advancement of the publique Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Now my Lord, for your own honour, and for the upholding of your ſervant, make me ſo happie, if there be any imployment for men of my profeſſion (as there is opinion) that I may be the man by your Lordſhips means, wherein you ſhall make me your obliged, as I am now your affectionate ſervant. For which you ſhall be aſſured of as thankful heart, as any breathes in the whole world.

This I know, his friends here that love him (which are many) are very ſorrie to part with him, for there is no melancholy where he goes. And therefore conſidering the condition of this place, we ſhall be great loſers, being upon a melancholy place, and ſervice, ill payed, ſick of all diſeaſes in the world, in a place that is next neighbour to hell, if the book printed ſay true, which ſaith, that the Low-Countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are next neighbours to the devil. And I am ſure, we are now ſeated lower then any part of theſe Countries; for the waters are above us, and about us, and we live in more fear of them, then of the enemy; for we may be drowned at an hours warning, if we do not continually work againſt it, and yet, and it ſhall pleaſe your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, this is the Seat for a Winter War. Many more inconveniencies we are daily ſenſible of, of which I have endured ſo much, as I dare ſay without vanitie, that few of my rank and fortune have ſuffered more, or longer then I have done in theſe Countries; having ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe 27. years together without intermiſſion; and all this for no other end (for I am 900 <abbr>l.</abbr> a year the worſe for the Wars) then to make me able to ſerve my Prince and Countrie when occaſion ſhould be offered.</p>

               <p>IT hath pleaſed your Lordſhip to write me three Letters lately: the one a particular liſt of officers, that ſhould be ſent from hence; the ſecond for Mr. <hi>Hopton,</hi> the third an acknowledgement onely of the receipt of my Letter to your Lordſhip. The firſt I have put in execution, and have written to your ſon, Sir <hi>Edward Conway</hi> to give them all notice of your Lordſhips Care of them. And to let them know how welcome any one ſhall be to me, that you think fit to be imployed. For one of them called Enſign <hi>Rainesford,</hi> I had ſet him down, becauſe I received your Lordſhips direction from himſelf. For Mr. <hi>Hopton</hi> I have written unto him according to your deſire, with your Letter incloſed; concerning the laſt, I give your Lordſhip many humble thanks for having expreſſed the acceptance by your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Touching your buſineſſe here: the State hath ben as contrary to us, as the wind. For though they ſee a great action likely to be performed to their own good, with little coſt to themſelves; yet they deſire to be ſo wiſe, as to make benefit, both wayes, and not to balk any advantage: which makes them ſtand ſo ſtiff upon the denying of us Officers, and Soulders by election, and will yield to ſend none but whole companies, onely to abate ſo much upon the repartitions. But Sir <hi>William St. Leiger</hi> and I, have utterly refuſed their offer as a propoſition againſt his Majeſties ſervice: for by this ignorant win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter war our Companies are grown half new men, having loſt moſt of our old, and of thoſe new men the half are ſick beſides: So that his Majeſtie ſhould be beholden to them, rather for names, then men:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:111544:85"/>And again for the Officers, and Soulders, it is like they ſhould be moſt of them the worſt in the regiment, from whence they are to come. Whereas if we might have had thoſe Officers we made choice of, which were but ten Captaines, and other inferiour Officers to the number of thirty, they might have been fit for imployment upon a double enemy. And I could wiſh, that whenſoever his Majeſtie ſhall be once furniſhed with Good Officers, it would pleaſe him to make account of them, as theſe men do, who have had long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and known their Value.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed my Lord the Duke to write to me a Letter, and to let me know he had choſen me his Officer, to attend, and obey him this journy: an honour too great for me, becauſe I did never expect it, but nothing ſhall excuſe my faults, ſaving my life. And among many other directions he commanded me to provide for the Army ſuch neceſſary things as cannot be had in England. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have thought of many, which I fear, I ſhall not have the time to get. In my care belonging to theſe proviſions, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the uſe of our ſmall pieces of Ordinance here, which they call Drakes, that ſhoot 70. Musket bullets. They will be of great uſe in this ſervice, both in regard of the quick landing, and of the paſſing of ſuch mountainous places, as perhaps we may meet withal, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in reſpect of the little hope we have to get any good muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, or at leaſt any great ſtore of them. But they are in ſuch favour here, as we can obtain none from hence, and ſo are forced by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent to buy ten of them here, that were provided for the King of France. And the reputation they carrie is ſuch, as they are readie mony every where. They coſt not much more then 400. ſterling, and I hope they will prove the profitableſt pieces that were ever uſed in the quarrel of his Maieſties Friends. We have likewiſe conſidered of what ſervice a company of Firelocks would be to the action, but the time is ſo ſhort, we cannot raiſe them. Howſoever we are promiſed of the States to have leave for a companie of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſſiers, which are of ſuch uſe upon all occaſions, that we cannot miſſe them. And we have choſe a brave and worthie Gentleman his Majeſties Servant and Subject who is willing to leave any ſervice for this, being the ſervice of the King. If they ſhould have been raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England, his Majeſtie muſt have payed for the horſes, armes, ſaddles, and piſtols, and yet not find any able to have ſerved in that kind.</p>
               <p>The wind (as yet) holds contrary, which hath made me ſend this by Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> who goes a way, that I dare not paſſe. But (I

The ſubſtance whereof was onely to ſhew you how thankful I hold my ſelf to your excellencie for ſo great and infinite a favour as it hath pleaſed your excellencie to think me worthie of. But as is it a favour that will ſet me on work all the dayes of my life: ſo is it greater then I can ever deſerve. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever my reſolution is to do my beſt. And I humbly beſeech your Excellencie to believe, that with my diligence, and the beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I have, I will ſeek nothing but to pleaſe you, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you; and if God ſay Amen to make the world ſpeak of your deſign as much (I hope) as ever our Nation hath given cauſe. And for the faults of my ſelf, and thoſe I ſhall bring with me, they ſhall not be excuſed, but with our lives, and bloods: for I hope I ſhall bring none, but ſuch as know what to do, and when they come to it will bite fooner then bark. I do promiſe my ſelf your Excellencie will have no cauſe to doubt or repent you of your favours, for I know what men have done, and what they can do in my occupation. But God is God, and men are but men.</p>
               <p>All my diſcouragement is, that the States anſwer not his Majeſties
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:111544:86"/>expectation being fearful (eſpecially ſince the loſſe of <hi>Breda</hi>) to part with any of their old Officers, or old Souldiers; but my hope is now better, for we have put them to another reſolution, by anſwering all their objections. By this diſpoſition of the States to the keeping all their old Souldiers, I wiſh your Excellencie will be pleaſed to be as careful in your choice, as you are deſirous of great deſigns. For otherwiſe the honour, and the charge will both be caſt away, as your Excellencie may perceive in ſome of our latter expeditions, ſeeing that although there are many called Souldiers in the world, yet but a few there be, that are ſo: for ſo long a man muſt live in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to inable him ſufficiently, that many grow unable to perform, what they know, before they have attained to the knowledge of what to perform. The knowledge of war being the higheſt of humane things that God ſuffereth mans underſtanding to reach unto.</p>
               <p>I have according to your Excellencies command made as many proviſions as I can for the ſhortneſſe of the time, of ſuch things as cannot be gotten in England. And I could have wiſhed I had known of this imployment but ſome months ſooner; for then I could have ſaved his Majeſty ſomewhat, and have added many things that would very much have advanced the ſervice. For in our profeſſion the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of things belonging to the war, doth more ſhew a mans experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and judgment, then any thing elſe, by reaſon the firſt errours are the begetting of many more, that afterwards cannot be avoided. Your Exellencie may be pleaſed to inform your ſelf of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployts, and undertakings of our nation, that none of them hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (for the moſt part) more then through the negligence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, as in victual, munition, boats for Landing, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of ſick men, to keep the reſt from infection. In this point of proviſion, it is not good to truſt upon a particular man, for gain is a corrupter where the care is not publique. And in ſo great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, one muſt do with living men, as they do with the dead, there muſt be overſeers and executors to have a true intent well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>I have preſumed to write thus much, to ſhew my thankfulneſſe to your Excellencie, and my great affection to his Majeſties ſervice, whereof I am infinitely poſſeſſed. I hear your Excellencie is in <hi>France,</hi> but my prayers to God are to ſend you ſafe, and happie home, for the World holds you the ſoule of advancing his Majeſties affairs, wherein his Honour is ingaged as it is, eſpecially in this action, being the firſt, and a Great One.</p>

               <p>IT hath not a little troubled your faithful ſervant at my laſt being with your Excellencie in <hi>White-Hall</hi> Garden, to underſtand (after I had attended ſo long) that I had ill offices done me to his Majeſtie, and yet the World is of opinion, that I have your Excellencies favor. I preſently went home, and ever ſince I have muſed and conſidered, and can find no reaſon or policie for my being kept from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties preſence, which maketh me and my neer friends aſtoniſhed. For hitherto I have received no favour, but rather the moſt ſtricteſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, that ever was uſed (and without example) to any man, that had ſuch a charge.</p>
               <p>And whereas there is no Commiſſion of any force, or validitie, without the aſſiſtance of the State, and Prince he ſerveth, for he that Commandeth is but one man, and the reſt are many thouſands, which are great oddes, yet I have been publiquely heard before the whole body of the Councel (my adverſaries ſtanding by) ſo curiouſly, as no inquiſition could have done more.</p>
               <p>For firſt, I was examined upon mine inſtructions, then upon my acts of Councel, then upon my journal, then upon a journal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of by ten ſundry perſons, which were under my Command both Landmen and Seamen, which was never heard of before, and I did not only anſwer in particular to all points that were demanded, but by writing which is extant: yet cannot I get any judgment or report made to his Majeſtie, but rather time is given to my enemies (as I hear) to make an ill report of me and my actions to the King. But when I was to be accuſed, there was no time delayed nordeferred, and ſuch men as I have proved guilty, and failed in the principal point of the ſervice, to have fired and deſtroyed the Shipping, are neither examined, or any thing ſaid againſt them, which is ſtrange, eſpecially Sir <hi>Michael Geere.</hi> So that I know not how my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> can take any thing ill from your Excellencie, unleſſe it be to have you do injuſtice, or againſt all reaſon. He may rather give your Excellencie many thanks, that his Lordſhip is not called into queſtion for letting paſſe the King of Spain's ſhips, that offered him fight, which would have been the chief ſervice, having inſtructions not to let any flie, or break out, without fighting with them.</p>
               <p>Now (my Lord) I humbly beſeech your Excellencie to conſider my Caſe, that hath been ſo ſeverely examined, and no body elſe, and that after my Examination, I have lingred ſo long in my wrongs
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:111544:88"/>and diſgraces, and by the ill offices your Grace doth ſee are done me to his Majeſtie, which will rather increaſe then diminiſh, ſo long as I ſhall be kept from the preſence of his Majeſtie, that is I know of himſelf the juſteſt Prince in the world, and yet to be in your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies favour.</p>
               <p>And I hold my ſelf clear of all imputations in deſpight of all malice and practice, that hath been againſt me, to obſcure all my endeavours which my adverſaries in their conſciences can beſt witneſſe, that when they ſlept I waked; when they made good chear, I faſted; and when they reſted, I toyled. And beſides, when they went about to hinder the journey at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> by railing on the beggerlineſſe of it, and diſcrediting of it, I was content to take it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, though againſt my judgment, as I did ſecretly deliver both to his Majeſtie and your Grace, before I departed from the Coaſt: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in my Letter to his Majeſtie all the inconveniencies that did after happen unto the Fleet: for had it not been in my obedience to his Majeſtie, and my good affection to your Excellencie, (that I did ſee ſo much affect it, and was ſo far ingaged) I would have been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther torn in pieces, then to have gone with ſo many ignorant and malicious people, that did ſhew ſo little affection or courage to his Majeſties ſervice, or any affection at all to your Excellencie. Yet for all this, all hath been laid upon me, having had rather hard cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes taken againſt me, then any way maintained in my Commiſſion which was given me, which no State, that I have ever heard of, did before. I pray God his Majeſties future ſervice do not ſuffer for it; for where his Majeſties Officers are not obeyed, he can never be ſerved.</p>
               <p>Wherefore my ſuit is, that if I have any ill offices done me to his Majeſtie, that I may clear my ſelf before him by your favour, which I have ſo long attended after; or by way of Petition, which the meaneſt Subject is not to be hindred in; for as I continue now, I have not onely wrong done to me, but I ſuffer as much puniſhment (without any fault) as if I had been condemned.</p>
               <p>And that your Excellencie will do me the favour to deal plainly with me, to let me know, why I am deferred from his Majeſties preſence, which is not denied to any, having received ſo much wrong.</p>
               <p>If my ſuffering be to adde any ſervice to your affaires in theſe troubleſome times, let but this honeſt friend of mine know ſo much, and I will ſuffer any inconvenience, as I have, miſery, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

               <p>I Underſtand that it pleaſed the Lords to grant the Colonels leave to accuſe me anew, and they have taken to them the moſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Seamen they could get to help their malice forward. I had thought, that before my coming, they ſhould have had time and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſufficiently to have ſhewen all their envie. And I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that they could not have deſired more, then to have been preſent when I ſhould be examined, and my journal read. At the reading whereof they took all the exceptions that might be, and I did anſwer them all in your Excellencies preſence, as I thought fully, whereupon they ſeemed to be ſo content, as they had no more to ſay; neither did they at that time deſire to make a journal, or to ſay any more.</p>
               <p>Then the Lords reſolutions were only to hear the Seamen ſpeak, upon whom all the buſineſſe did lie. If they may be ſuffered upon new Combinations, to bring new ſlanders upon me, I cannot tell what to think of it. But this I can ſay, that if this courſe be taken, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie will never be without a mutinous Armie. (which all States in policy do ſhun) For when the Common Souldiers ſhall ſee their Chiefs give them ſuch examples, they will ſoon follow, being that all Armies are ſubject to it, eſpecially a new Armie. I had thought that one Trial had been ſufficient, being it was before ſuch an Aſſembly. But if I ſhould be accuſed, I ſhould deſire to have new accuſers, and not the ſame that have already accuſed me, (for ſo there would be no end) &amp; that upon their Petition, I might have been heard what I could juſtly ſay, why they ſhould not have leave to make a journal, and not to give them leave before I were heard. I am afraid there was never any ſuch preſident before, and what inconveniencies may come of it time will ſhew.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:111544:89"/>
               <p>I have ſought to none of the Lords as I fear my enemies have done, (I know not whether I ſhall ſuffer for it or no) but my truſt hath only been in your Excellencie and the juſtneſſe of my Cauſe. I have been your Excellencies Officer in as difficult and as miſerable an action as ever any one hath undertaken, and with as little aſſiſtance as ever any one had. For many of thoſe that ſhould have aſſiſted me, were more careful in betraying me, then in forwarding his Majeſties ſervice. And if this courſe be held to encourage them, there is no man ſhall ſuffer more then his Majeſties ſervice will. For it will be folly for any man to look to his Majeſties ſervice, or to take any pains to prevent, or hinder that which may be committed againſt it; But to let every man do what he will, ſo all will be pleaſed, and he that Commands ſhall have no man to ſlander him, which is the way to live in quiet.</p>
               <p>Thus much I thought was fit for me to let your Excellencie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and withal, that I held it a great unhappineſſe for me (that have taken ſuch toyl and pains, and ſuffered ſo many ſlanders) to be kept back by my enemies from that honour, that never any one of my rank and place was hindered in, which is from kiſſing the hand of my Soveraign Lord the King All Power is in your Lordſhips hands; whether you will uphold me in my juſt cauſe, or no, or let me be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated for want of it.

               <p>Before my arrival I furniſhed the two Prizes, three <hi>Brigandines,</hi> and a fourth Boat with Eirelocks, and combuſtible materials for the burning of the Pyrats ſhips within the <hi>Moal,</hi> and had trained my men in the execution of their ſeveral duties, and likewiſe appointed a ſquadron of boats with ſmall ſhot to reſcue the veſſels of execution in their advancement and retreat.</p>
               <p>The firſt night of my arrival being the 21. of <hi>May</hi> laſt, the veſſels of execution were all advanced, but by reaſon of contrary winds they were commanded to retire.</p>
               <p>The ſecond and third nights they were alſo in a readineſſe, but were withheld with calmes.</p>
               <p>The fourth night it pleaſed God to bleſſe us with a fair Gale, and they being advanced again, and the two ſhips with the fire-works, having almoſt recovered the mouth of the <hi>Moal</hi> (the wind to our great grief) turned to the oppoſite point of the Compaſſe.</p>
               <p>The boats performed their directions in towing of the ſhips, but conſidering, that by the continuance of the courſe, they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their principalleſt men to hazard, by reaſon of the great ſtore of Ordnance and ſmall ſhot, which plyed upon them, they debated amongſt themſelves what to do, Capt. <hi>Hughes</hi> (who commanded one of the Brigandines) replyed, Go on, and give the attempt with the boats, which they cheerfully purſued, crying out without ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> God bleſſe King <hi>James,</hi> and fearleſſe of danger (even in the mouth of the Canon, and ſmall ſhot, which ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>The cowardly Turks, who before durſt not ſhew themſelves to ſo weak a force, but from the walls or the tops of their houſes, ſo ſoon as they perceived all the boats retyred, opened their ports, and Salli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in 1000. and by the help of ſo great multitudes, and a ſuddain ſhower of rain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>During that Stay, there there came out of the Moal only one Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, which we forced to run on ſhoare.</p>
               <p>Other ſervice by us there performed, was the ſinking of one of their beſt men of war by Sir <hi>Thomas Wilford,</hi> and Captain <hi>Chidleigh,</hi> ſhe was mann'd with a 130. Turks and 12. Chriſtians, whereof 12. onely eſcaped, the reſt were either ſlain or drowned, which appeared both by the relation of divers Chriſtians which nightly eſcaped aboard us, and by divers of the dead bodies that floted upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by our ſhips. We took likewiſe before their faces in the Bay a Fly-boat, which the Pyrats had formerly taken from the Chriſtians and ſold to <hi>Ligorn.</hi> In her Merchandize to be exchanged for Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats goods, and ſome mony amounting to 2000. and odd pounds, the exact account whereof I ſhall not fayl to addreſſe to your Lordſhip as ſoon as the ſame is perfected by the councel of War.</p>
               <p>The Turks hereupon preſently manned out three Gallyes to reskue here, but Captaine <hi>Giles,</hi> and Captain <hi>Herbert,</hi> with the help of three Brigandines, which I ſent out to ſecond them, ſoon fetcht her up, and brought ther unto me, and the Gallies were put to flight by Sir <hi>Thomas Wilford,</hi> Captain <hi>Pennington,</hi> and Captain <hi>Childlegh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of my aboad there, after the attempt made by the boates, I attended ten dayes for an opportunity to ſend in the ſhips with the fire workes, to finiſh the ſervice begun by the boats; but in all that time there happened not a breath of wind fit for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, notwithſtanding the ſhips were allwayes ready at the inſtant,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:111544:91"/>that they ſhould receive my directions to advance. But at laſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by the Chriſtians (that eſcaped by ſwimming) aboard me, how the Pyrats had boomed up the Moales with Maſts, and Rafts, ſet a double guard upon their ſhips, planted more ordnance upon the Moale, and the walls, and manned out twenty Boats to guard the Boome, and perceiving likewiſe, that they had ſent out their Gallies, and boates both to the Eaſtward and Weſtward to give advce to all the ſhips upon the Coaſt, that they ſhould not come in during my aboad there, and ſo finding no hope remaining, either by ſtratagem to do ſervice upon them in the Moale, or to meet with any more of them, in the regard of the daily complaints brought unto me, both from ſome of the Kings ſhips, and moſt of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of their want of victuals, I reſolved by the advice of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of war to ſet ſail, whence I made my repair to this place, where I met my Brother <hi>Roper</hi> with your Lordſhips dirrections which I have received, and at the inſtant obeyed, by ſignifying his Majeſties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure declared by your Lordſhips Letter unto the worthie Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thoſe four ſhips whom his Majeſtie hath pleaſed to call home.</p>
               <p>But my Lord, in the duty I owe your Lordſhip, and my zeal to his Majeſties honour and ſervice, I humbly beg your Lordſhips pardon to advertize your Lordſhip, that ſeeing we have now made this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Pyrates, and that they perceive that our intent is to work their utter ruine and confuſion, the recalling of theſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Forces before the arrival of others in their ſtead, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving us of ſo many worthy and experienced Commanders, I fear may prove more prejudicial to the ſervice, then upon one daies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I dare preſume to ſet down in writing, by encouraging the Pyrats to put in execution ſuch ſtratagems upon us, as to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they have already taken into their conſideration. My reaſons for the ſame, I ſhall be bold upon more mature deliberation to offer in all humbleneſſe unto your Lordſhips judicious view, either by the Commanders that are to return unto your Lordſhip, or by a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which divers of the Councel of War adviſe to be addreſſed over land on purpoſe with the ſame.</p>
               <p>And ſo being ready (ſo ſoon as we have received in our water, and diſpatched divers other buſineſſes, which of neceſſity muſt be ordered in this place) to ſet ſail for <hi>Malega,</hi> there to receive in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of Victuals, and to take my leave of theſe 4.

               <p>IT is not unknown unto your Lordſhip, that Sir <hi>Thomas Button</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming out, thought himſelf much wronged in that he did not hold the place of Vice Admiral in this Fleet, whereof I muſt acknowledge him very worthy, and that for my part I had ingaged Sir <hi>Richard Hawkins,</hi> a very Grave, Religious, and experienced Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, before I was aſſured whether Sir <hi>Thomas Button</hi> would leave his imployment in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or no; and that afterwards Sir <hi>Thomas Button</hi> by your Lordſhips mediation, was contented to undertake the charge he now holdeth, which God knowes I laboured for no other end, then for the ſecuritie and advancement of his Majeſties ſervice, by reaſon of the experience I have had of his ſufficiency and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Since that time, I have doubled that injury. A wrong was done unto him which cannot be denied, he patiently appealed to me for juſtice, which I muſt confeſſe I denied him.

               <p>MY laſt to your Lordſhip was of the 18. of this preſent from <hi>Stokes Bay,</hi> ſince which time I have received two from your Grace, at <hi>Deep</hi> one by your Secretarie Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> whereby your Grace commands me to deliver up his Majeſties Ship, and the reſt under my Command, to the hands of ſuch <hi>Frenchmen</hi> as his Chriſtian Majeſtie ſhall appoint, according to his Majeſties pleaſure ſignified by my Lord <hi>Conway.</hi> And that I and the reſt of the Maſters take ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of them for our ſhips ſeverally according to the true valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:111544:92"/>And to ſee this put in execution, you ſent your Secretarie Mr. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> And the other by Mr. <hi>Ingham</hi> in anſwer of mine written from <hi>Stokes Bay.</hi> The former part whereof being only a command to put your former in practice, and the latter a denial of my humble ſuit for my being called home from this Service. Which ſaid part confirms abſolutely, that it was not your Graces pleaſure that I ſhould yield up the ſhips into their hands, and diſpoſeſſe my ſelf and companie of them: for I truſt your Grace had no ſuch unjuſt thought as to continue me here alone after.</p>
               <p>The French had poſſeſſion of her to be their ſlave, as I am ſure they would have made me if they had their wills. To give your Grace an account of what I have done ſince I came to <hi>Deep</hi> (which was the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. at this inſtant about nine of the clock at night) would be too tedious for this time. The 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. in the morning Earlie I ſent my boat aſhoare with my Lievetenant to find out your Graces Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie, to receive my Letters, whereby I might know your Graces pleaſure, and to kiſſe my Lord Embaſſadours hands from me, and to let him know I was come with his Majeſties ſhip to do him ſervice, but could not command the reſt to come along with me, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters not being there, and all their companies in a mutiny. But his jelouſie was ſuch, that he would not ſuffer your Graces Secretary to come aboard, or to ſend me your Letters, or that my Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould ſpeak to him, but in his preſence, but preſently ſent a Gentleman aboard to me, commanding me to come aſhoar to him, which I confeſſe I was very loath to do, in regard my people were much diſcontented, and readie daily to mutiny, being all wonderous unwilling to go againſt <hi>Rochel,</hi> or thoſe of their religion. And beſides, I never having been a ſhoare, ſince I came into my command, neither on our own Coaſt, or elſe where. (It being not my uſe) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe particulars knowing his Greatneſſe, and your Graces pleaſure, for the giving him all due reſpect, I preſently went to him, where he taking me into a roome apart with your Graces Secretary, he firſt delivered me my Lord <hi>Conwaies</hi> Letter, or rather a warrant, (for ſo he tearms it himſelf) for the delivery of the ſhip into their hands (as they interpreted it) and then your Graces Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, commanding me to ſee his Majeſties pleaſure (ſignifyed by my Lord <hi>Conwaie</hi>) put in execution. And laſtly a letter from the King of France, thereby willing me to receive his Souldiers aboard that he had provided, and his Couſin the <hi>D. de Mommorencie,</hi> and to go preſently, and to joyn with his Great Fleet againſt his rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. This is the effect of that Letter. Having read all theſe letters,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:111544:93"/>he would preſently have poſſeſſion of the ſhip that night, for that he could not ſtay longer. I told him, that I did not underſtand it ſo, but that I was to render all ſervice to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie; but nothing would ſerve him, ſave the preſent poſſeſſion, which becauſe I would not yield unto, he grew into a ſtrange furie, telling me, that your Grace had ſent your Secretary to ſee her delivered, and ſecurity to be taken for her. My anſwer was, that I was ready to obey, according as I underſtood the warrant, which was to do his Chriſtian Majeſtie ſervice, and to receive a convenient number of Souldiers aboard me. But to diſpoſſeſſe my ſelf of my command, I had no ſuch order: but ſtill nothing wold ſatsfie him but the ſhipe, telling me, he would not entertain at the moſt (if they were willing) above 60. or 80. of our people. My anſwer was, I had no order to diſcharge a man of them, neither could I, but if they were diſcharged, what they ſhould do, or how they ſhould get home, having neither meat, mony, nor clothes, I know not. To the firſt of theſe, he told me, that Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> had order by word of mouth from your Grace to diſcharge us, which Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> confirmed, as alſo to ſee the ſhip delivered, which he commanded me to do. But with your Graces pardon I durſt not do it upon words, it being a buſineſſe of too high conſequence, neither if I had been willing, would my companie ever have condeſcended to it. To the ſecond, for our paſſage, he promiſed to have provided barques for us; but to conclude this, and not to inſiſt upon the reſt of the particulars (they being too tedious) his rage and fury was ſuch, that I muſt of neceſſity give a little way thereto, or elſe I think he would have kept me aſhoare, ſo as I told him I was content if my company would yield thereunto, and therefore deſired to go aboard to ſpeak with them, and to give order for the drawing up of the inventorie. And upon this he ſuffered me to depart, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out promiſes of a large ſumme of mony which ſhould be given me at the ſurrender, beſides a royal penſion during my life, he ſending his Secretarie, and many others aboard with me to ſee all things put in execution, and your Graces Secretary to perſwade me to do it. But when I had them aboard, I told them it was a thing not preſently done, neither was my companie willing to deliver over the ſhip without a more ample warrant, yet I would do my beſt to bring both to paſſe ſo ſoon as I could. So uſing them with the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I could, and fair promiſes, that I would uſe all diligence for the accompliſhing of their deſires; though I muſt confeſſe I never meant it, till I ſhould hear further from your Grace, and have an eſpecial Warrant from his Majeſtie, or your Grace for it, it being a buſineſſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:111544:93"/>of ſo high a nature. Vpon theſe hopes they departed, and went a ſhoare, where they had not been long, till ſome of them returned back with a ſtrange allarum from his Lordſhip, that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently have poſſeſſion of her, or my reſolution to the contrary. And althoug I alleadged that the inventory, and other buſineſſe would not be diſpatched in two dayes, it would not ſuffice, except I would receive 400. Souldiers aboard in the mean time till things were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>Thus ſeeing I could not delay him till I heard farther from your Grace, I was forced to give him this reſolute anſwer, That upon this Warrant, I would not deliver over the ſhip unto him, neither if I would, would the company give way unto the ſame, we not holding it a ſufficient diſcharge for us: But that we were ready to receive a competent number of Souldiers aboard, with a chief Commander, and to go upon ſuch ſervice, as his Chriſtian Majeſtie ſhould direct us, according to the agreement with the King my Maſter; but nothing would ſatisfie him but to have her delivered over to him, which if I did not preſently, my head ſhould pay for it. I deſired his patience for two or three daies, till I had written and ſent to your Grace, and that he would let me have a Shallop for that purpoſe; but he denied both the one and the other; notwithſtanding ſent away a Barque himſelf with one to your Grace, but would not ſuffer me to ſend thereby, which made me the more jealous of the real intent of the buſineſſe. The 23. he ſent your Lordſhips Secretarie aboard to work and perſwade me, but I could not give other anſwer, then I had done formerly, only that I would attend until I heard farther from your Grace; though I muſt confeſſe I had much ado to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my Company, who were very unwilling to it. But I had hope ſtill to have a more ample Order how to proceed in this great and weighty buſineſſe. And upon the 24. at two of the clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mr. <hi>Ingham</hi> (whom I ſent from <hi>Stokes Bay</hi> to your Grace) retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto me with two Letters, one from your Grace, and another from my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> the former part of both commanding me to put your former Commands in execution: but the latter part prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting me to depart with my charge, gave me the more courage to ſtand upon my former tearms.</p>
               <p>This day your Graces Secretarie came aboard me again, after I had ſent your Graces Letter to him, being ſent by the Embaſſadour to proſecute the buſineſſe, for the deliverie of the ſhip unto them. But after I had ſhewed him, that part of your Graces Letter, he knew not what to ſay to it. I willed him to tell the Embaſſadour, that this
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:111544:94"/>Letter was nothing but an anſwer of mine written from <hi>Stoken Bay,</hi> concerning the not coming of the reſt of the ſhips. I further offered his Lordſhip this day for the more expedition of the buſineſſe, to take 150 of his men aboard, and to run over for the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and to ſend preſently to your Grace, that we were ready to ſurrender over there, upon an authentique Warrant from his Majeſtie, or your Grace. His anſwer to this was, That he would not put his men in to be priſoners, nor that we ſhould be the major part. I then offered him to take in as many French as I had Engliſh man for man, but without arms, yet nothing would ſatisfie him, but the poſſeſſion of the Ship, either by delivering of her over into their hands, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving 400 armed men aboard, wherewith they would quickly have taken her from us, as you may plainly ſee their intent by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Which I refuſing to do, this night about ten of the clock, he ſent his Secretarie aboard with three or four others to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt me, as a Rebel to my King and Countrey, as you may perceive by the Copie of it, which I ſend your Grace herewith, and this he ſaid was the laſt he would have to do with me, for that on the morrow, he would away for <hi>Paris.</hi> Whereupon the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ſent this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Ingham</hi> unto him to know, what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice he would command me, and whether he would have me attend his pleaſure longer here, for that I was ready to go upon any ſervice they would command according to the former agreement, and to receive as many men aboard as poſſibly I could; but he ſaid he had nothing to do except I would either deliver up the ſhip, or take in the 400. Souldiers. In the interim came his Secretarie, with the ſame company he had before, and made another proteſtation againſt me, in regard I would not take in his 400. men, and therewithal brought me a Letter from your Graces Secretarie, (for he is ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that he will not ſuffer him to come aboard but when he liſteth) which Letter was, That the Embaſſadour would ſtay till Thurſday next, if I would give it him under my hand to deliver up the ſhip then, if I had not order to the contrary before, which I had as good have done at the preſent; for I expect no Letters from your Grace, in regard they would not ſuffer me to write to you, as I deſired. And if your Grace ſhould write to me by his meſſenger, they would be ſure not to deliver them, till the day were paſt, except ſuch as were for their turn.</p>
               <p>In all which your Grace may ſee their intents, that there hath been no ſlights or wayes left unaſſayed to bring their purpoſe to paſſe: firſt by fair words, then by ſeeking to get me become the French
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:111544:94"/>Kings ſervant, with promiſes of a great Penſion, and brave employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with offers of good ſums to be laid down upon the ſurrender of the ſhip as aforeſaid. And when none of theſe courſes could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with me, then followed their threatnings of having my head, and ſuch like. All which (I thank God) I have withſtood; for I had rather live all my life with bread and water, then betray my King and Country of ſo precious a Jewel as this; and had rather the King ſhould take my life, then to have a hand in the ſurrender, or valuing of ſuch a Bulwark of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Upon the making of the laſt Proteſt, and with the threats they gave us, my Company grew into ſuch a fury and tumult, that they got up their Anchors, and ſet ſail for England, without acquainting me with it, or order from me, ſaying, They would rather be hanged at home, then ſurrender the Kings Ships, or be ſlaves to the French, or fight againſt thoſe of the Religion. But I muſt confeſſe, I heard what they were a doing, but let them alone, becauſe I ſaw they had reaſon; otherwiſe, I ſhould rather have died amongſt them, then to have ſuffered it.</p>
               <p>And thus I have related the principal paſſages unto your Grace, wherein, if I have offended his Majeſtie, or your Grace, it hath been for want of diſcretion, and not of true zeal to do his Majeſtie, your Grace, and my Countrey ſervice, which if it be found to be an offence, I humbly crave pardon.</p>
               <p>I am now come to an anchor in the Downs, where I ſhall attend your Grace's farther pleaſure, to be diſpoſed of as his Majeſtie, and your Grace ſhall pleaſe. But to return again to <hi>France,</hi> I can aſſure your Grace, that all the people in the ſhip will rather be hanged then do it, they have been ſo well uſed there.

               <p>Secondly, That they may bring as many of their own Nation aboard as they will, and they ſpeak of putting in as many French as Engliſh, which will amount to 500. in all, which the ſhip is neither able to carry, neither will it be for the health of thoſe that go in her, or ſafety of the ſhip to his Majeſtie. All which I deſire may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of, and a courſe ſettled with the Embaſſadour of the juſt number I ſhall receive aboard.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, That there is no Clauſe for the ſupply of the Victuals, and other proviſions before the ſix moneths be expired, ſo that they may keep us till that time, and then turn us off naked and deſtitute of all proviſions to be a prey to our enemies.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That we may know where we ſhall receive our ſupplies of powder, and other munition from them, for that the three laſt, which we have in here, with the appurtenance, is not ſufficient to maintain a fight of three hours.</p>
               <p>The former five Articles I humbly deſire your Grace judiciouſly to conſider of; and what your Grace will have me therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, may be inſerted in my inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Now further I humbly deſire your Grace;</p>
               <p>Firſt, That all we Engliſh may be of a ſquadron, and not ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon any occaſion, the accidents of the Sea excepted, and that we may be ready at all times to ayd and aſſiſt one another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That I may have power in my inſtructions, or otherwiſe, for the command of the reſt of the Engliſh that go along with me, if not, every man may take his courſe, and do what liketh him beſt, which may prove prejudicial to the ſervice, diſhonourable to the State, and dangerous for the ſafety of his Majeſties ſhip.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I humbly deſire, that your Grace will be pleaſed to give order, that there may be ſome proviſion of Cloathes laid in for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, (whereof there are many in the ſhip) as hoſe, ſhoes, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:111544:95"/>ſhirts (at leaſt.) As alſo ſome proviſion of ſtore for ſick men, of Oatmeal, Rice, Sugar, and fruit, and ſome little ſtock of money, to relieve them if neceſſitie require it. It may afterwards be deducted out of their wages, if your Grace will have it ſo.</p>

               <p>VVIth my former dated the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this moneth, I ſent your Honour two Letters for his Majeſtie, and promiſed by my next to write unto your Honour at large, about the matter they did contain.</p>
               <p>In performance whereof, and for the diſcharge of my dutie, I will now deſire permiſſion hereby freely to deliver my mind, for ſo much as is yet come to my knowledge, and I judge meet to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to paper concerning the ſame. And ſeeing this Packet is to be ſent by an expreſſe Meſſenger, and a
<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Carie.</note> perſon of truſt, I will for your Honours greater eaſe abſtain from the uſe of a Cipher.</p>
               <p>After I had been at <hi>Lovain,</hi> and <hi>Antwerp</hi> to take ſome depoſitions for the diſcovering of the authours and correctors of that moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious Libel, <hi>Coronae Regia,</hi> (as by a diſpatch to the late Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie <hi>Lake</hi> I did advertize his Majeſtie,) there came unto me a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon, living about this Town, going by the name of <hi>Nicholas de Laken,</hi> and brought me the Packet, which a good while ſince I ſent to your Honour. Amongſt other things, he told me, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore by accident, he fell into the company of a Cannon of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain,</hi> with whom he had ſome ſpeech about that diveliſh book, and that if I would ſend thither, he was very confident, he ſhould pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate farther by his private induſtrie in the ſpace of a few dayes into the myſterie then I had been able to do in the compaſſe of divers years, with my publique information.</p>
               <p>Here upon to make a tryall, and deſiring to imploy <hi>Le ſee et Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd,</hi> for the manifeſting of a truth, which I knew his Majeſtie ſo much longed to underſtand, I furniſhed him with mony, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:111544:96"/>and ſent him to <hi>Lovain.</hi> At the end of ſix or ſeven dayes, he returned from thence, and as his own letters do teſtify, and (he hath proteſted with many oaths) he avouched to me, that he had diſcovered that ſecret to the very bottom. I inquired of him, by what meanes? He made anſwer by the help of the ſaid Canon, and ſome young Schollars his countrie men, Students, in that univerſity, who had brought him to the acquaintance of a certain Italian living there, that had ſerved the author of the book both while he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and while it was in printing. He averreth alſo that <hi>Putea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and ſome others, had their fingers in that unſavorie Pye. And he ſaith, that when I began to make ſearch for thoſe perſons, which had done his Majeſtie that intollerable wrong, that the principal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, and <hi>Flavius</hi> the Printer were ſecretly warned, to get them out of this country, and had ſome meanes given them to maintain them abroad. He affirmeth likewiſe, that both of them ever ſince that time, have remained, and are at this preſent remaining out of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the Archdukes. That he hath often ſeen the ſayd authour in this Citty, and knoweth his name, and Surname, and his perſon ſo well, as no change of his apparrel, nor diſguiſing of his body, can cauſe him to miſtake or be deceived. By his report, that party is no. Clergie man, though he be a good Schollar, and reputed to have an excellent Latin pen. But thoſe commendable quallities, are drowned by his greater vices, he being much addicted to lewde wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and unſatiable drinking. He is now (by this mans informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) reſident in a town upon the Frontiers of Germany, And as for <hi>Flavius,</hi> he can (if he truly) declare where he lurketh, and aſſureth me, that his wife is at a place within ten leagues of this town. The Cannon that did overſee the preſſe, and withdrew the leaves of this booke, as they were printed, is called (as he heard) Mr. <hi>Claud.</hi> and dwelleth at <hi>Noſtre Dame de Halles,</hi> whither I purpoſe to ſend him this Eaſter holidaies to make farther inquirie. More then theſe, and ſome other particulars (which are ſo tranſcendent, as I dare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe, nor ſet them down in writing) he will not impart unto me, until he be aſſured of his Majeſties protection, by a Letter under his hand, and a competent reward for his labours. And the reaſon he alledgeth therefore is, that if once it be known, he did meddle in this matter, there can be no more ſafety for him to continue in theſe provinces. He doth further undertake, that in caſe his Majeſtie will be pleaſed to grant him his demands, allow mony for the expences of the journy, and give him two perſons of courage, and fidelity to accompanie him, he will either loſe his life, or put the ſayd author
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:111544:96"/>into their hands who may carry him (as he thinketh) with little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either into the Pallatinate, or the united Provinces. Hereupon I gueſſe, that (if this report be well grownded) that wicked fellow muſt be in, or near about the town of <hi>Cullen.</hi> I cannot amongſt all thoſe of my acquaintance, and his Majeſties ſubjects here call to mind any one ſo fit for this interprize, as the Gentleman whoſe name is written in Cipher in my letter to his Majeſtie. For he is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally well ſpoken of for his honeſtie, and other good Parts, and in ſundry occaſions hath given good teſtimony of his ardent deſire to do his Majeſtie ſome remarkeable and meritorious ſervice. And his ſufficiencie being better known to his Majeſtie then to my ſelf, I will not commend it any further. The want of imployment and ſome diſguſtes he received in Holland, while he ſerved there, compelled him by neceſſity to looke for preferment under the King of Spain. But hitherto his religion, the reſpect he beareth to his Majeſtie, and my perſwaſions, have detained him from thoſe Courſes. By him I am told, that he hath heard out of the mouths of one Captain <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,</hi> and his ſon in law Captain <hi>Hamilton,</hi> pencioners to the King of Spain (but ſubjects to his Majeſtie, that they being one day walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtreet at <hi>Antwerp</hi> called the Major Brugg (where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide) with 4. or 5. others in their companie, and there happening ſome ſpeech amongſt them, about a book his majeſtie had then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt the Pope, it fell out that one of them apprehending that opportunity ſaid, that he had ſubject enough to furniſh a book which ſhould more vex the King of great Brittain, then his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties book could offend his Holineſſe, and if he could meet with a Schollar, that were able to put it into a method, and good latine, he would be ready to perform his word. Another of the troop made anſwer, that he would undertake the work upon that condition, and they both (for a great whiles after) were abſent at <hi>Lovain,</hi> even about the ſame time that the Libel was forged. Perhaps ſome part of this, may draw neer to the verity. But they both depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King of Spain (as is before mentioned) and being averſe in religion, I am much afraid, I ſhall do little good upon them by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them before the Arch Dukes Commiſſioners, ſeeing they may delude me, and the truth with equivocation, and mental reſervation. Although he conceiveth, that if they were called before a judge, and ſummoned upon their oathes to ſpeake the truth, they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to diſcharge their conſciences. I have ſeriouſly intreated him to beſtow his beſt indeavour in attempting what he can further learn about this relation, and he hath accepted to perform my requeſt.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:111544:97"/>The ſaid Gentleman from whom I had it is not willing to be brought publiquely upon the Stage, for this buſineſſe, leſt thereby he ſhould incurre the note of an informer, then which nothing is, or can be more odious in theſe parts. Nevertheleſſe he hath promiſed (if his Majeſtie like to have it ſo, and will be pleaſed to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement for it) to juſtifie what is before rehearſed to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Whether both theſe parties encounter upon one, and the ſame authour, or underſtand them to be divers men, I can neither judge, nor fortell: yet it ſeemeth that one of them may hit on the right. And as I will not ſpare any paines, charges, nor peril whatſoever to bring the parent of this child of darkeneſſe into the light, ſo I hope his Majeſtie (whoſe cauſe it is) will not refuſe to hazard a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to give himſelf ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Theſe things having paſſed in this manner, I humbly beſeech your Honour at a fit opportunity, when the King is alone to acquaint him with theſe particulars, and intreat his Majeſtie to keep them ſecret; for I am of opinion (being ſpoken under humble correction, and without offence) that had not his Majeſtie by communicating this buſineſſe at the firſt to <hi>Mounſieur Borschot,</hi> given him meanes to advertize it to his wife (who by tatling divulged it, and foyled the way) we had never been put to half this trouble, but had taken <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> in the form, and by him diſcovered the authour. My intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, that his Majeſtie ſhould be induced to put 2000. Piſtols (or the ſumme that ſhall be allotted <hi>Laken</hi>) into his hands, before the ſervice be done; but that his Majeſtie would vouchſafe (if he approve the project) to cauſe ſo much mony, as in his profound wiſdom, he ſhall think meet for this occaſion to be forthwith remitted to me by Mr. <hi>John More,</hi> by the meanes of Mr. <hi>Ducket,</hi> a Marchant dwelling in Milk ſtreet in London, to be repayed at <hi>Antwerp</hi> by Mr. <hi>Lionel Wake</hi> trading there, or by the companie of our Engliſh Marchants at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> in the name of reward for ſervice done, or to buy Tapeſtries, or linnen for his Majeſtie. And I will either return it back again by exchange, if this deſign cannot be effected, or defaulk the remaines thereof upon my entertainment. All that I would venture in this caſe, ſhould only be for thoſe mens neceſſary expences that are to be imployed therein; and that alſo I would have not to exceed, but to be limitted within the compaſſe of 200. pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>By apprehending theſe men, the Arch-Dukes cannot take any juſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:111544:97"/>occaſion of offence againſt his Majeſtie or his Miniſters, ſeeing one of them is not their Vaſſal, and both are out of their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>It may (for theſe Conſiderations) pleaſe your Honour to adviſe with his Majeſtie, whether it be fitter to proceed herein <hi>Via facti,</hi> or <hi>Via Juris:</hi> to ſend <hi>Laken</hi> to ſeek out the Author and others to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, or the Printer, or upon promiſe of a reaſonable recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his pains, to deal with him effectually to declare their names, and habitations, and afterwards leave it to his Majeſties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Princely pleaſure to proſecute or let fall his action. In either of which kind, I will yield humble obedience to his Majeſties Commands, and your Honours directions, as things to my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. But I am doubtful, that by continuing of the courſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly holden in the carriage of this buſineſſe, we ſhall never attain our deſired ends. I am not ſo ſlight as to give credit to all reports, nor ſo prodigal as to part with money for nothing.</p>
               <p>My moſt humble and earneſt ſuit is, that his Majeſtie, and your Honour after mature deliberation upon the ſeveral points of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will vouchſafe to ſend me by my ſervant <hi>Marſham</hi> (who is now at <hi>London</hi>) particular, and diſtinct anſwers for my better direction. I have been the more prolixe upon this ſubject, in hope that this I have written ſhall ſerve once for all.</p>
               <p>In that matter concerning the Counteſſe of <hi>Argile,</hi> which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your Honour to recommend unto my Care, I have done as much already as I can for the preſent. We muſt of neceſſitie with a little patience expect the ſucceſſe, whereof your Honour ſhall in due time be punctually advertized. In the mean while, I do with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, deſire your Honour to excuſe the tediouſneſſe of this Letter; And ſo take my leave,</p>

And the Oath I have taken to his Majeſtie, will not permit me to conceal any thing from his knowledge that cometh to mine, and may in any ſort have relation to his Royal ſervice. For theſe Conſiderations I aſſume the boldneſſe ſo ſoon to renew your Honours trouble, after the diſpatch of thoſe Volumes of Letters which I ſent you yeſterday by one of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p>This Bearer <hi>de la Forreſt</hi> is better known to your Honour, then to my ſelf, although I remember many years ago to have ſeen him in England. During his ſtay in this Town, he brought unto me a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, calling himſelf the Viſcount of <hi>L'orme,</hi> and Sir <hi>De la Pommeraye;</hi> who hath (by his own relation) been a great Navigator, and been authorized by 18. of the chief Pyrats in the <hi>Levant,</hi> to ſearch for their pardon, and retreat into ſome Chriſtian Countrey, being ſorry for the ill they have done, and deſirous to ſpend the reſt of their daies in peace. With this Commiſſion he came into France, and there travelled ſo far with the King and his Miniſters, as he obtained a general abolition for the ſaid Pyrates, a ſafe Conduct to bring them into his Dominions, and a procuration (which I have ſeen under the great Seal of France) to treat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with them upon certain conditions. But he being envied by ſome Grandees of that Kingdom, and by misfortune happening to kill a man, he was forced (as he pretendeth) for the ſafety of his life to flie into theſe Countries, before he could bring that work to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>And being now disinabled to return thither again, he deſireth to make a tryal, whether his Majeſtie will vouchſafe to lend his ear to that Treatie, and grant unto the ſaid Pyrates a general Pardon. To which effect, he ſendeth over <hi>La Forreſt,</hi> and hath intreated me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him with my Letters to my Lord Admiral, your Honour, and Mr. Secretarie <hi>Calvert.</hi> For retribution of this grace, the ſaid Pyrates offer to give 45000 <abbr>l</abbr> ſterling to be ſhared amongſt you three, or to be diſpoſed of as his Majeſtie ſhall appoint. But your Honour may ſee the Conditions propoſed to the French King were more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. For they were to give him their Ships, Artillerie, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:111544:100"/>Munition, and to furniſh means to ſet out ſome men of War for his ſervice.</p>
               <p>And I ſee no reaſon (in caſe his Majeſtie ſhould encline to ſuch capital offenders, and common enemies) why he ſhould not have as much, or more benefit then another Prince, the greateſt part of them being his Vaſſals.</p>
               <p>Your Honour if you pleaſe may peruſe theſe adjoyned Papers, and impart the contents of them to my Lord Admiral. They agree with their Originals; and if his Majeſtie do not taſte this overture, there is no more harm done (for any thing I can perceive) then the loſſe of my labour to peruſe and ſubſcribe them.</p>
               <p>There remaineth onely two points, wherein I ſhould ſpeak to your Honour, the one is, that this matter may be concealed from the French Embaſſadour <hi>Mounſieur le Count de Tilliers,</hi> for fear of ruining de <hi>L'Orme.</hi> The other with gratifying <hi>La Forreſt</hi> with the pay of a Pacquet (if your Honour ſhall think it meet) for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of theſe Letters, who ſaith your Honour is his great Patron, and hath promiſed him a good turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mounſieur de L'Orme</hi> hath given him power to ſollicite this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and procure him an anſwer; wherein I joyn my humble prayer, that the poor man may not here languiſh in hopes, and ſpend his money to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>When I ſhall know whether his Majeſtie will relliſh this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or not, I will write thereof more largely (if there be cauſe) otherwiſe let it remain as it was before. In the mean while, I humbly take my leave; And reſt</p>

               <p>I Can give your Lordſhip no great account of any thing that hath occurred ſince my departure. I was bold to write to Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie <hi>Calvert</hi> from <hi>Maliga</hi> of the great increaſe of the Pyrates in thoſe Seas, and of the danger of the Merchants; with my own thoughts, if his Majeſtie have any farther purpoſe to attempt their deſtruction, which is both honourable and neceſſarie; if theſe Trades, or the other of <hi>Spain</hi> to the South of the <hi>North-Cape</hi> be of any conſequence to his Majeſties Kingdomes: if they be ſuffered to increaſe, they will brave the Armies of Kings at Sea in a few years, and attempt even the Coaſts and Shoares with peril. And becauſe they carry the name only of Thieves, they are yet contemned, or neglected; but they will become a dangerous enemie, when they ſhall rob with Fleets, and therefore would be in time conſidered. The Spaniards now make great offers to continue the Contract, though their performance be ſlow, and their own Eſtates chiefly intereſſed, yet beſides the danger and ruine of the Merchant it is conſiderable, that this Army increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is at the obedience of the Grand Seignior the common Enemy, who hath no ſtrength but Gallies. I know your Lordſhip will collect enough out of this without further preſſure. The Armado's of <hi>Spain, Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> have been in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> the Turks Forces ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the black Sea. Yet they have done nothing of conſequence, taken a few Carmiſales and ſlaves, and are returned to the Port, where <hi>Don Philibert</hi> of <hi>Savoy Generaliſſimo</hi> is preſent, who is made Viceroy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> with abſolute power to diſpoſe of all offices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attendance from Spain, which is more then Vice-Re. He hath uſed me for his Majeſties honour with very great reſpect, as I have in particular adviſed Mr. Secretarie. Among many courteſies, finding 13. Engliſh Captives in the Gallies, I thought it my duty to ſuccour them. His Highneſſe at the firſt inſtance, to expreſſe his good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to my Maſter, gave them to me all free, which I think is a good work, and not ordinary. I beſeech your Lordſhip, that his Majeſtie may be pleaſed to take knowledge of it into Spain for the Princes honour, that he may in the like occaſion, not think himſelf neglected.</p>

                  <salute>My dear Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have ſince my departure from you uſed all diligence in the Princes ſervice, and punctually obſerved all his Commands. Onely with the King I have dealt ſo freely in my relation of the Prince his carriage, and your extraordinary care of working his content in all points, that I did move him to ſhed tears in expreſſing his happineſſe for ſuch a ſon, and likewiſe his good fortune in having a Favourite, who is framed according to his own heart in all points. Neither have I preſſed any thing to injure any farther then my dutie bound me, and my faithful love to your ſervice, which ſhall alwaies have a prime place in my heart.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there are contrary opinions in Court and City, by the one you are much admired for your noble expreſſions of true honor, and love to your King, Prince, and Country, with many obſervations of your ſpecial care and zeal to Religion, and your immovable reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to Conteſt with all oppoſitions to the contrary. By the other you are maligned, and they give it out, That you have with your wilfulneſſe occaſioned theſe delayes, by diverting and changing their waies wherein they had begun to treat: but the falſeneſſe hereof hath been ſhewen, and it appears malice without ground, the which, (though heretofore I have told you,) not out of any other end then
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:111544:102"/>to do you ſervice, yet have you ſo ſlightly regarded me for it, and ſo much reſpected thoſe ill-deſerving Great ones, (as if you had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to receive your enemies into your boſome, and to caſt off your faithfulleſt friends;) yet ſhall not any uſage diſcourage me from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the office of a moſt loving and zealous affected friend, and ſervant, yea inſomuch, that I will rather diſpleaſe you, in doing you that faithful ſervice, that both my honour and love obligeth me to, then be ſilent, and they let you run into apparent danger.</p>
               <p>My Lord, amongſt the proteſtants your are divulged (as much as ill diſpoſed ones dare) a Papiſt. Among the Papiſts, it is avowed you are the greateſt enemy they have. For which reports, I am not troubled, for they have made you the much more pittyed, and as highly eſteemd, and honoured amongſt the moſt juditious, and beſt deſerving ſubjects, as any thing could do. And I dare aſſure you, that ſince your being at <hi>Madrid</hi> you are much better beloved of all people (who have not ends) then you were before. Noble Lord, I find the King both reſolute, and couragious, but wiſe, and ſecret, to my own hearts joy, and not to be won upon by the ſubtil and falſe policie of any. I made it my humble ſuit upon my knees, that he would conſent to no propoſition of this Spaniſh Embaſſadour concerning peace or war, till the Princes return. Which ſuite he tooke well at my hands, and granted. I have told him freely what I obſerved in Spain, both of their manners, uſage, and honeſtie, and left it to his wiſedom to make what uſe he pleaſed. His Majeſtie longs to ſee the Prince, and you, and ſo do all the ſubjects, and will not be ſatisfyed with any thing, but your ſpeedy return. Except you have jelouſies put into the Spaniards heads, and prevent the danger, which will be by haſting the marriage with all poſſible ſpeed; for there are ſome whoſe buttons break with venom, that you have got ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſo well deſerved of the King and Prince. But you believe me not, but think I ſpeak of Spleen, when God knowes I never bore any to any man, but for your ſake. Your moſt vertuous lady mourns for your abſence, and will not be comforted. Your fair Daughter deſerves your ſtaying withall, and your faithful friends and the good of the Kingdom want you moſt of all</p>
               <p>And for your greater comfort, the King is ſo reſerved in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces affaires, as that he neither imparts the buſineſſes of Spain, nor his intents therein to any of hit privie Councel. Since your pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the Earl <hi>Marſhal</hi> is become a great ſtranger at the Court. But all men find you ſo faſt revited into the Kings, heart that they ſee it is an impoſſibility to work you any way diſpleaſure in your abſence,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:111544:102"/>and therefore forbear to expreſſe, what willingly they would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but find it in vain to go about it. But let not the Kings love to you or their ſmall ability to do you harm, make you too careleſſe, or too credulous of thoſe your enemies, laſt it give too great incouragement to them, and too great diſhartning to your faithful friends. I am ſorrie at my being with you at <hi>Madrid</hi> that you durſt not impart thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, wherein I am ſure my faithfulneſſe, and love unto you, would have done you all ſervice (as the thing I moſt deſire) but I ſee the zeale of my heart to you, is not rightly conſidered, yet am I confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that time will make me beſt known, and better eſteemed by you as one whoſe true heart, is alwayes watchful of taking all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to do you ſervice. My Lord, you ſhall find me not only a word-friend, but an active, who never am better pleaſed, then when I find moſt oppoſition. And for concluſion, I am ſo far from ſhunning dangers to do you ſervice, as that I would willingly wade in blood at any time to manifeſt my ſelf yours. And therefore) I ſhould receive great content, if you knew, how truly I were yours, becauſe then I am ſure in the Nobleneſſe of your nature, it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any to be able to do me wrong in your Honourable. thoughts. My dear Lord, pray ſuffer no longer delayes in Spain, but either diſpatch what you went for quickly, or elſe return ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily; for aſſure your ſelf, their deſire to have you continue there, is for no love to you, but to further thereby their own deſigns elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Nay I dare juſtifie it out of my own weak judgment, that the longer you ſtay, the farther off you ſhall be from obtaining, what you deſire. And if you reſolutely purpoſe your return with ſpeed, you will force them out of their dull pace, and put them upon the rock, from which they cannot eſcape, except they fulfil your deſires. Beſides, your preſence is moſt neceſſary here for home-affairs, for your abſence hath cauſed too great inſolencie in the Court, by ſuch as bear themſelves very loftily, and inſult very much over yours, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your poore ſervant <hi>Mewtis</hi> is much threatned as being yours, and muſt ſuffer till you come back. Some other things likewiſe are otherwiſe carried in your abſence, then would be in your preſence, therefore for Gods ſake return, but with the Prince, and count de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, denyals. And the longer you ſtay there, the ſtronger you make them and your ſelves the weaker. My Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> hath a great, and more powerful party in Court, then you imagine, in ſo much, that I am confident were the King a newter, he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and I do not much marvail at it, for you truſt upon the honour, and juſtification of all your actions, deſirous to make no friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:111544:103"/>you need none, but he deales with a great deal of cautelous wiſedom, and as he hath wrought into the Kings opinion, by reaſon of ſome pleaſing ſervices, ſo hath he into all thoſe, who are about the King, or powerful, that they may better his good ſervices, and ſmother his bad. Beſides the man who is ſuſpitious (as he muſt needs be) hath far greater care of after-reckonings, how to make fair gloſſes, then he who doth all things with the avowment of all honour, and the only intent of ſervice to his King, and Country. It grieves me I am not thought worthie to hear from you any word by theſe laſt meſſengers, eſpecially being promiſed the imployment, from which I was put. Farewell (dear Lord) and the Almightes protection be upon our unmatchable Prince, upon whoſe worth, and brave at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements all eyes are fixed, and the ſame protection light upon you his right hand, and give you the good fortune, to make as brave a return, as you did voyage thither, to the eternal praiſe of your future memories.

And in that manner do I humbly offer to your Majeſties Conſideration in this importune <hi>Chriſis</hi> of the affairs of Chriſtendom, ſo much as I have obſerved in <hi>France,</hi> that may now concern your ſervice, in which place I have been, heretofore imployed in your affaires.</p>
               <p>And firſt conſidering the preſent eſtate of things in France, and weighing againſt it, the ſeizure made of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the late invaſion of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and now this new defeat arrived in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> I do put this for an infallible ground, that either the King of <hi>France</hi> will reſolve out of jealouſie of the progreſſions
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:111544:104"/>of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> effectually to ſuccour the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or elſe abandoning the affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> to their own ſucceſſe, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the increaſe of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> on that ſide, he will think more then to recompence himſelf, by taking this opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the body of thoſe of the Religion in <hi>France.</hi> And as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he will reſolve on one of thoſe two points, ſo on both of them for ſundry reaſons he cannot. To move him to the ſuccour of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the main motive will be, the jealouſie between thoſe two Monarchies, which can never die, ſo long as they do both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in no greater a diſproportion of ſtrength and power; As alſo that <hi>France</hi> ſhall by their uſurpation of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> be on all ſides Circled by the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and particularly on that part where <hi>France</hi> hath before uſurped on the Empire; in which regard his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of eſtate is greater then your Majeſties in the Conſervation of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> though your perſonal intereſt be incomparable with his. Then he cannot but think of the loſſe of his Correſpondencies, and breach of his Confederacies in <hi>Germany,</hi> which have been very ancient, and very particular with the houſe of the <hi>Palatine.</hi> And if the reaſon of mutual gratitude, and vindication of injuries, may move Frenchmen, there are plentiful arguments on both kinds to move them to defend the Houſe of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> againſt that of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi> But now on the other ſide to move him againſt thoſe of the Religion at home, firſt doth preſent it ſelf, his ſucceſſeful beginning againſt them in the buſineſſe of <hi>Bearn,</hi> then which nothing could be more unjuſt, both in regard of the matter it ſelf, and of his own faith, and promiſe, and of the deſert of thoſe of the Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, in theſe late troubles, nor could any thing be more ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, or violently (I do not ſay cruelly) executed, then that was. And again the preſent tearms, wherein that King, and thoſe of the Religion do ſtand, will puſh him on. Then there will not want to this purpoſe, the powerful perſwaſions of the Pope, and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, both by propounding overtures to lay aſleep the jealouſies of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and offering huge ſummes towards the charge of the War, which if he ſhould attempt, and prevail therein, it would prove of far greater prejudice for many reaſons that may be given in the intereſt of Eſtate, to your Majeſtie, though not in the intereſt of your affection, then the loſſe of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What may in <hi>France</hi> be reſolved upon theſe motives, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>But I do conceive hereupon, that it may be uſeful for your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſervice effectually to propound in <hi>France,</hi> a Confederacie for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:111544:104"/>the Conſervation of the Palatinate, to which if they do hearken, your Majeſtie ſhall proceed in that deſign with greater ſtrength and reputation, and occaſion the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to proceed with greater remiſſeneſſe, or elſe abſolutely to relinquiſh the Palatinate by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But if in France it be not hearkened to, your Majeſtie may take it for an aſſured argument, that they mean to proceed againſt thoſe of the Religion, in which caſe your Majeſtie may make uſe of the ſame Embaſſage to revive again ſome of their factions in the Court, whereby thoſe of the Religion may be ſtrengthened in their defence, and it will not be hard to effect, if it be well proceeded in. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth properly offer it ſelf the perſon of the Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> who for his great experience and wit, and intelligence in that Court, is beſt able to guide and further your Majeſties intentions; and for his intereſt in the perſon of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> and in the converſation of thoſe of the Religion, doth preciſely ſquare with your Majeſties ends, whoſe advice you may firſt ſuddenly and ſecretly enquire. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THe Arch-Duke <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> brother to the Emperour, made his entrie into this Town on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the laſt moneth, <hi>Stil. Vet.</hi> He was met by the Almirante of <hi>Castile</hi> two daies journey from this place, who went from hence well accompanied, and attended by many Liveries richly ſet forth. Some 400. paces without a Gate of this Town called <hi>Alcala,</hi> the Arch-Duke was received by the two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and the Cardinal, and about 200 paces without the ſaid Gate by the King himſelf, who came attended with the greateſt part of this Court, and in his Coach accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Newbergh,</hi> and the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Olivarez:</hi> The King lighted out of his Coach to receive the Arch-Duke, and ſome complements being paſt between them, returned into his Coach, and ſet the Arch-Duke by him on his left hand; in the other end of the Coach ſet the two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; in one boot the Duke of <hi>Newbergh,</hi> and the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Olivarez;</hi> and in the other the Emperours Embaſſadour, and the Almirante; the Almirante taking place of the Embaſſadour. Being come to the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:111544:105"/>Palace, the King accompanied the Arch-Duke to the Queens Quarter, where his Majeſtie left him to be conveyed from thence to his own Quarter (which is the ſame was given to the Prince his Highneſſe at his being in this Court,) by the Infants his Brothers, as he was, having finiſhed his complements with the Queen, and the Infanta <hi>Dona Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> There were preparations here making for the honouring his reception with ſeveral feaſts, and entertainments after their manner here. But theſe have been ſtopped by the Arch-Dukes ſickneſſe, who felt himſelf indiſpoſed the day after his arrival, and applying ſome Phyſical remedies by the advice of a Phyſitian which he brought along with him, his diſtemper increaſed, and as it is pretended by theſe Phyſitians by a wrong courſe held with him. What hath been the true cauſe of his infirmity, I leave to be diſputed by them; He hath been held divers dayes with a terrible Calenture, which proved at laſt a <hi>Tabardillo,</hi> whereupon there was little hope conceived of his life; but he hath ſince received ſome eaſe, and is now in a good way of amendment. In reſpect of the Emperours unworthy proceedings with the King our Maſter, I have not dared to viſit him, untill I ſhall have notice of his Majeſties pleaſure therein, which I ſhall be glad to underſtand from your Grace.</p>
               <p>Since the expiring of the Truce betwixt this Crown and the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> this King hath given Licenſe to divers Port Towns on the Coaſts of <hi>Biſcay</hi> to arm out what ſhips they ſhall think good, and to make prize to their own particular benefit of what they ſhall light upon belonging to the enemies of this Crown: by which meanes it is here hoped, That theſe Coaſts will be much the better ſecured from the daily pillages of the Holland men of War, and the Turkiſh Pyrates. For the advancing whereof upon requeſt made of thoſe of <hi>Sevil,</hi> there is Licenſe given unto them to arm what men of War they can find means. The Duke of <hi>Maqueda</hi> likewiſe with leave hath lately ſet forth ſix ſhips which are abroad in Pyracie.</p>
               <p>There is advice given hither, that the Duke of <hi>Brandenbergh</hi> hath given his conſent to the conferring of the Electoral dignitie upon the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which I can hardly believe, though I find it aſſured from very good hands.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Newbergh</hi> remains ſtill in this Court, and preſſes to carry a cleer reſolution in his buſineſſes from hence; but for any thing I can yet learn his negotiation remains in the ſame eſtate as I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in my laſt to Mr. Secretarie <hi>Conway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Armada prepared in <hi>Portugal</hi> for the recovering of <hi>Braſil</hi> is gon to Sea, and whereas, they were to have ſtayed at the <hi>Cape</hi> St.

                  <hi>Vincent</hi> for the Armado of Caſtile, upon advice, that is given hither, that the Hollanders in <hi>Braſil</hi> are not able to make any reſiſtance of conſideration, they have order to proceed in their journey. Twenty ſhips of war, and 4000. land Souldiers (which is the force of that Fleet) being here held ſufficient for that enterprize. The Armado in <hi>Cadiz</hi> is not yet departed, but hath her men aboard, and there is daily expectation of newes that it is gone to Sea. The Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> having received letters from the King our Maſter, and the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſent preſently coppies of them unto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, with his anſwers unto their Majeſties, and accompanied them with a letter of his own unto the Emperour. All which the Emperour ſent unto the King. The carriage of the Duke is much eſteemed here, for having given (as I am informed) by his Letters unto the King our Maſter, and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſuch an anſwer as they are here much ſatisfied withal. Nothwithſtanding in this Letter to the Emperour with many reaſons, and much inſtance, he adviſes him to apply himſelf to the ſetling of the peace in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing much affection to the compoſing of the affaires of the Prince Palatine doth earneſtly intreat his Majeſtie not to deſtroy that ancient houſe. In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> uſes all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to combine himſelf with this Crown, and now doth offer to caſt off all other thoughts of leagues, and to depend wholly upon Spain, ſo that this King will protect him in his Electoral dignity, and what he hath lately poſſeſſed himſelf of in thoſe parts. This offer of the Dukes hath been ſeveral dayes debated in Councel, where the Marqueſſe <hi>Ynoioſa</hi> hath been buſie in the behalf of the Duke: but the wiſer part of this Councel ſeeing how prejudicial, the increaſe of the Dukes greatneſſe may prove to the Empire, do no way favour his pretentions. They likewiſe hold fit to continue the ſtate of things in a poſſibility of an accommodation without our Maſter.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Duke <hi>Don Carlos</hi> hath brought power from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to proceed to the conſummation of a marriage betwixt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſon and the Infanta <hi>Donna Maria,</hi> wherein he ſayes, he hath nothing to Capitulate, but brings them a blanck paper, and hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and order to confirm what conditions they ſhall here ſet down. The Emperour's Embaſſadour doth much preſſe to proceed to the Capitulations, but there is yet nothing done. The Infanta of <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> hath lately written hither, importing this King to admit of a treaty of marriage betwixt the Prince of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and the Infanta his Siſter, extolling with many expreſſions the worth, and parts of that Prince.</p>

               <p>There hath been ſome moneths a general ſtop of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings here in all ſuites of Engliſh Merchants depending in this Court; but I have at laſt procured a <hi>Junto</hi> to be aſſigned for the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Engliſh Cauſes, wherein I am promiſed there ſhall be a ſpeedy Reſolution taken of whatſoever is at preſent in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> hath lately advertiſed hither from <hi>Millain,</hi> that the French King, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> do miniſter much occaſion of jealouſie, that they intend to attempt ſome novelty in thoſe parts, and doth therefore deſire, that his Troops may be augmented; whereupon (above the ordinary charge) there was inſtantly remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him 2000. Duckets.</p>
               <p>The great annual <hi>Aſſiento</hi> which this King makes with the <hi>Genoueses</hi> is newly concluded, it is for 7. millions, whereof 4. are remitted for <hi>Flanders,</hi> to be paid by monethly portions.</p>
               <p>In a late meeting of the Councel of State upon a diſcourſe that paſſed amongſt them, taking into conſideration this Kings wants, and the preſent diſtemper of his affairs, the Inquiſidor General ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing how neceſſary a time it was for his Majeſties Subjects to aſſiſt his preſent occaſions, made offer of 100 Duckets for his part, which the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Olivares</hi> followed with a tender of 300; the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Monterrey</hi> of 100; all the reſt of the Councel of State following their example gave according to their quality. Notice being taken of this abroad, the Condeſtable wrote a Letter unto this King, wherein he made tender of 200 Duckets, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Caſtel Rodrigo</hi> of 100, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Carpio</hi> of the like ſumme. Divers others have likewiſe declared themſelves in this donative, and it is hoped that it will go over the whole Kingdome, and bring in an extraordinary Treaſure into the Kings purſe.

                  <salute>Good Mr. Secretarie,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have never more deſired to be preſent at any Conſultation, then that which is this day to be handled, for my heart, and all my heart goeth with it. But my Foot is worſe then it was on Friday, ſo that by advice of my Phyſitian, I have ſweat this whole night paſt, and am directed to keep my bed this day.</p>
               <p>But for the matter, my humble advice is, That there is no going back, but a countenancing of it againſt all the world; yea ſo far as with ringing of Bells, and making of Bon-fires in <hi>London,</hi> ſo ſoon as it ſhall be certainly underſtood that the Coronation is paſt. I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in my Conſcience, that the Cauſe is juſt, wherefore they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that proud and bloody man, and ſo much the rather, becauſe he hath taken a courſe to make that Kingdom not elective, but to take it from the donation of another man. And when God hath ſet up the Prince that is choſen to be a mark of honor through all Chriſtendom to propagate his Goſpel, and to protect the oppreſſed, I dare not for my part give advice but to follow where God leads.</p>
               <p>It is a great honour to the King our Maſter, that he hath ſuch a Son, whoſe virtues have made him thought fit to be made a King. And me thinks I do in this, and that of <hi>Hungary</hi> foreſee the work of God, that by piece and piece the Kings of the earth, that gave their power unto the beaſt, (all the Word of God muſt be fulfilled) ſhall now tear the Whore and make her deſolate, as St. <hi>John</hi> in his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath foretold. I pray you therefore with all the ſpirits you have to put life into this buſineſſe, and let a return be made into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> with ſpeed, and with comfort, and let it really be proſecuted, that it may appear to the World that we are awake when God in this ſort calleth us.</p>
               <p>If I had time to expreſſe it, I could be very angry at the ſhuffling which was uſed toward my Lord of <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> and the ſlighting of his Embaſſage ſo, which cannot but touch upon our Great Maſter who did ſend him, and therefore I would never have a Noble Sonne forſaken, for reſpect of them who truly aym at nothing but their own purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Our ſtriking in will comfort the <hi>Bohemiant,</hi> will honour the <hi>Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> will ſtrengthen the Union, will bring on the States of the Low Countries, will ſtirre up the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and will move
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:111544:107"/>his two uncles the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together with <hi>Tremoville</hi> (a rich Prince in France) to caſt in their ſhares. And <hi>Hungarie</hi> as I hope (being in that ſame cauſe) will run the ſame fortune; for the meanes to ſupport the war, I hope <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videbit Deus.</hi> The Parliament is the old, and honourable way, but how aſſured at this time I know not, yet I will hope the beſt; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if countenance be given to the action, many brave ſpirits will voluntarily go. Our great Maſter in ſufficient want of mony, gave ſome ayde to the Duke <hi>Savoy,</hi> and furniſhed out a prettie army in the cauſe of <hi>Cleve.</hi> We muſt trie once again what can be done in this buſineſſe of a higher nature, and all the mony that may be ſpared is to be turned that way. And perhaps God provided the Jewels that were layd up in the Tower to be gathered by the Mother for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Daughter who like a noble Princeſſe hath profeſſed to her Husband not to leave her ſelf one Jewel rather then not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo religious, and righteous a cauſe. You ſee that lying on my bed I have gone too far, but if I were with you this ſhould be my lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which I pray you humbly and heartily to repreſent to the King my Maſter, telling him, that when I can ſtand, I hope to do his Majeſtie ſome ſervice herein. So commending me unto you, I remain</p>

               <p>OUt of <hi>Spain</hi> we hear, the world comes ſo faſt after you (ſince your departure,) as we aſſure our ſelves this great work is at a good end, with contentment to our bleſſed Prince, and like a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaty, with addition of honour to the Monarchie, he intends to match with.</p>
               <p>But Sir, we hear of a new treaty ſprung up between the <hi>Palſegraves</hi> Eldeſt ſon and the Emperours youngeſt Daughter. A Labrynth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, what hope ſoever leades us, I fear no one thread will be able to guide us well out. Becauſe in the paſſages between theſe far diſtant Princes education of children ſeemes like to be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:111544:107"/>Ballancing of Councels to the jelouſie of friends, Queſtion whether the Palatinate ſhall be delivered in the Nonage before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or after. Then whether ſequeſtred into a Catholique, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants hands. If into a Catholique, a probable argument that both it, and the <hi>Valtoline</hi> are equally reſerved free to fall with aſſociated forces upon our antient Bulwark the <hi>Nether-Lands</hi> at pleaſure. Laſtly whether the Myter, and theſe Scepters thus united, with their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in number of ſwords, and Deskes abroad, their new ſpringing partie at home, ſtrengthes by ſea and land, Conſtant ambition of adding Crown, to Crown, and perfect Auditt of their neighbours powers, and humors (even while the ſecond Heire male of this Kingdom ſhall live in the hands of enemies, and ſtrangers) I ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe will not prove fearful in equalities, caſual to the lives of our King and Prince, dangerous to the Crown by changing ſucceſſive rights into tenures of Courteſie, and charging of the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with viſions of confuſion or bondage.</p>
               <p>Again (Sir) admit this new project ſhould vaniſh into ſmoak as undigeſted vapours uſe to do, yet give me leave to queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to your Grace you have overtlie proteſted againſt the intricate Courſes of the Spaniard, even the ſpecious iſſue of the Palatinates delivery before conſummation of marraiage, but not like to prove Mother of many Colourable and unavoydable delayes. Becauſe, ſuppoſe the propoſition ſhould be granted, yet who ſees not that the effecting of it will prove an act of ſo many parts. Viz: the Pope, Emperour, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> Duke of of <hi>Bavaria</hi> &amp;c. and of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence joyntlie, and ſeverally to them all, and muſt of neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire divers aſſemblies, commiſſions, perchance Dietts &amp;c. And then what time the execution of the Minutes under theſe Heads will demand, he that knowes the divers natures of Nations in treating may eaſily conceive.</p>
               <p>To begin with the leaſt; what mony or other conditions can be offered like to ſatisfie the honour, humour, and huge expence of the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> for quitting his Conqueſt to ſo unreconcileable a nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghbour: and if there be poſſibility, yet out of whoſe eſtate or treaſury are theſe conditions, or large proportions of Dowrie probably to be expected? touching the Emperour; Is there any forraign alliance able to perſwade this Prince, who having by an untimely war, changed all tenures of Election into ſucceſſion, and thereby ſhaken the antient freedom of our <hi>Germany</hi> Princes, what I ſay can in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood winn him to reſtore theſe dead forces of his Enemies, to the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:111544:108"/>prejudice of all he injoyes, or aſpires. Beſides what ſhall move this Emperour to take away the Bann from the <hi>Palſegraves</hi> perſon, who hath ſo deſparately hazarded not only his own private Kingdomes, and Provinces, but by his undertaking, waved the main ambition of of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> familie. For the Spaniſh King if he be preſt, his anſwer will be ready and fair, that he hath no right in him (but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation) as appeares by the diviſions already made. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how little right ſoever pretends, yet his Councel, his inſtruments, his charge, by diverſion, <hi>Overt Ayde,</hi> inſenſible ſuccours (the world ſees) have been uſed in all theſe wars; ſo as this together with his right by ſtrong hand gotten (and kept by arts of depoſiting) upon the <hi>Voltaline</hi> may lead us to diſcern clearly, that he finds the paſſage of his forces through them, equal, and ſo reſolves both, to over-run the Low countries when he pleaſe. Againſt which little State (whether out of revenge, or ambition of greater conqueſts by them, he will conſtantly carry a warchfull and Griping enemies hand.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Pope, who knowes not that his univerſal affected ſupremacie (howſoever diſſembled) yet hath, doth and ever will urge his Holineſſe to ſtir up colourable Warres of Religion. Since Warres, Contentions, and tumults among Princes have been his old way of adding more wealth, and power to his ſanctified Sea. How I ſay this new faſhion'd Monarch, ſhallbe won to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Heidelberg</hi> (the moſt dangerous neſt of Heretiques after <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>) to return to her former ſtrength is a poynt beyond my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
               <p>By theſe ſhort, haſtie and imperfect images your Grace may yet judg, that except the reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> be inſtantly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (and like a work of Faeries either furniſhed, or broken off at once) we may eaſily be over-ſhot in our own bowes, by having the ſtrengths and free Councels of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> during this treaty kept under a kind of Covert-baron, and ſo long made a forge for other Princes ends, as my Bleſſed Soveraigns truſt may perchance find it ſelf compelled to play an After-Game, amongſt diſcouraged friends, and combination of powerful enemies, ſuch as under cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of <hi>Allyance</hi> will think they have won one great Step towards their inveterate Ambition of a Weſterne Monarchie.</p>
               <p>Noble Duke, If you find me lifted above my earth, in handling a ſubject to which I am utterly a ſtranger, yet bear with a Monks hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, in a man that is priſoner to old age. Hide my follie from the

               <p>THe reaſon why I have not of late written to your Honour, is the diſcontinuance of our Seſſions of the Synod this great while; but ſince my laſt unto your Honour, we have thus ſpent our time. The publique reading of all the Collegial judgments upon the 5. Articles was made an end of. In which (God be thanked for it) there was a greater harmonie and conſent then could almoſt be hoped for, in ſuch variety of learned men, who did not know one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judgment. The onely difference was in the ſecond Article. After that the Preſident (never asking advice from the Synod) took upon him to conceive, and dictate the Canons himſelf to us; but we who were ſent by his Majeſtie, conceiving that courſe to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the dignity of the Synod, conſulted with ſome of the Delegates, who approved our Counſel, and thought it fit, that there ſhould be ſome deputed by the Synod, and joyned to the Preſident for conceiving of the Canons, that ſo whatſoever was done, might be done by publique authority. This motion did trouble the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent not a little, who hath all the Provincials at his beck, and ſome of the forraign Divines too, but eſpecially the <hi>Palatines.</hi> Yet there was a publique Synode called for this purpoſe, where the Preſident of the Delegates did make a ſpeech, deſiring the Synode to depute ſome who joyned with the Preſident and the Aſſeſſours, might take pains for moulding of the Canons. In the delivering of the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces moſt teſtified their diſlike of this courſe, and their ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Preſidents Credit; but <hi>Scultetus</hi> did by many reaſons approve the courſe which the Preſident had begun, and diſprove this
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:111544:109"/>new courſe, which was ſuggeſted, yet he taxed no man perſonally. But <hi>Sibrandus</hi> (when he came to deliver his voice) like a mad-man did inveigh againſt thoſe, who were the ſuggeſters of this change, and ſaid, That ſtrangers ſhould not take upon them to preſcribe what was good for the eſtate of their Church, and that ſome others who had joyned in that, were worthy to be noted <hi>Cenſurâ Eccleſiaſticâ:</hi> there in he aymed at the South <hi>Holland,</hi> who did likewiſe much diſlike the Preſident his Courſe. <hi>Sibrandus</hi> ſpake ſo furiouſly, that both the <hi>Praeſes Politicus,</hi> and the <hi>Praeſes Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> deſired him either to hold his peace, or elſe ſpeak that which might not diſturb the peace of the Synode. Yet ſince it was the Delegates pleaſure, the whole Synode added to the Preſident, and the Aſſeſſours three forraign Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> my Lord of <hi>Landuff, Sculte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us,</hi> and <hi>Deodatus;</hi> 3. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials, <hi>viz. Poliander, Vallaeus,</hi> and <hi>Triglandius;</hi> who ſhould mould and conceive the Canons upon every Article, and then ſend a Copie of what they have done to every Colledge, that they may adde power, and change what they will, the Colledges obſervations being conſidered by them, and the Canons according to them amended, they are to be returned to the Colledges, and the Colledges to return them again, and ſo to keep the courſe ever till there be no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt them. When they are thus agreed upon by all ſeveral Colledges, they ſhall publiquely be concluded, and approved by the Synode.</p>
               <p>We are now hard at poliſhing the Canons, which theſe Deputies ſend us. All our trouble is in the ſecond Article: The moſt part of the Synode would cry us down with voices for the reſtriction of the general propoſitions in Scripture, and the Confeſſions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches concerning Chriſts death, <hi>ad Solos Electos.</hi> We ſtand for leaving them unexpounded, and unreſtricted as we found them, and rejoyce exceedingly, that the Directions which my Lord Embaſſadour ſent us from his Majeſtie concerning this point, agreeth ſo fully with our judgment ſubſcribed with our hands, given in to the Synode, upon the ſecond Article. By this doing we firſt leave a ſound and ſufficient ground for preaching of the Goſpel to all men. Next we ſhun a great deal of offence, which otherwiſe we muſt needs have given to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches. Thirdly, we retain the ſame phraſes, and forms of ſpeaking which thoſe Fathers did, who wreſtled with the <hi>Polagians</hi> in the ſame point. If this Article be well looked into, I hope there ſhall moderation enough be obſerved in all the reſt. If it were not for the moderation of the forraign Divines, we ſhould
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:111544:109"/>have ſuch Canons as I think have not been beard of; for there is never a Provincial Miniſter here, who hath delivered any rigid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and hath been taxed by the Remonſtrants for it, but he would have that Propoſition thruſt into one Canon or another, that ſo he may have ſomething to ſhew for that which he hath ſaid. As ſoon as the Canons are agreed upon, I ſhall by Gods grace with all expedition ſend them unto your Honour. Our next work will be <hi>Verſtius,</hi> whoſe book they would cenſure, without citation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Proſident wrote to our Colledge in the Delegates name to know, whether we thought it fit to have him perſonally cited; but eſpecially to know what we thought would be moſt agreeing to his Majeſties mind.</p>
               <p>To the latter, concerning his Majeſties mind, we anſwered, That we thought my Lord Embaſſadour could give them the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for that point.</p>
               <p>For the former, we thought it would be evil taken, If any man ſhould be condemned, not being firſt heard. But becauſe they, that <hi>Vorſtius</hi> would keep them as long as the Remonſtrants had done; We told them, That we deſired they would not ſuffer him to make any defences, or explications of his blaſphemous propoſitions, but ſimply to anſwer <hi>per ita velnon,</hi> whether he would plainly abjure them, or not; And ſo accordingly proceed againſt him, and ſo we ſhould make no great loſſe of time; ſo I think he ſhall be perſonally cited.</p>
               <p>This is all, for we have had no Synodical meetings theſe 12. daies. I can ſee no end of the Synode before <hi>Whitſontide.</hi> With my beſt prayers for your Honours, and the remembrance of all my faithful reſpects. I take my leave; And am</p>

               <p>BEſides the relation of the apparance of change in the affairs of the Court, wherewith my Diſpatch to Mr. Secretarie <hi>Lake</hi> will acquaint your Majeſtie: I thought it my duty to give you particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account, that being yeſterday with the Prince of <hi>Jain ville,</hi> after ſome earneſt proteſtations made to me of his deſire to do your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie ſervice, falling into diſcourſe of thoſe occurrences, he grew into theſe terms. That the complaints of the Queen Mother were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon good reaſon; that if ſhe had offended the King, or the State, why did they not make her proceſſe? if ſhe had not offended, why ſhould ſhe not ſee the King, and her children? that when the Queen fell upon theſe Complaints, they thought to fright her, by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bring forth the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> but that the Queen had aſtoniſhed them, by telling them, That ſhe was ſo far from oppoſing, as ſhe deſired the liberty of the Prince. That the Queens friends would be glad of his liberty, for that it could not be prejudicial, but rather advantagious, at the leaſt, it would be honourable for them, if his liberty were wrought, if not by their interceſſion, at leaſt by their occaſion; further he told me, That he was confident, that the Queen would not be gained by their fair words, but would perſiſt in her reſolution. Which diſcourſe of his with ſome other advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth perſwade me, that this matter hath a farther root, and is likely to bring forth ſome great alteration here, in no long time. And I doubt not but that <hi>Monſieur de Luine</hi> will find with repentance, how much better it had been for him, to have furthered your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties advice for the delivery of the Prince, whereby he might have acquired to the King a reputation of Juſtice, and to himſelf an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of a powerful friend in the Prince, rather then to leave him to the adventure of the changes, that time may produce. But if your Counſel did prove fruitleſſe to them by their miſconceit of it, yet it doth, and will every day prove more honourable to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, who by your wiſdom have foreſeen, and by your goodneſſe have premoniſhed all your neighbours of the miſchiefs that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them.</p>
               <p>Peradventure they may overcome this <hi>effort</hi> of the Queenes by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:111544:110"/>fair words to her Perſon, and threats ſignified afar off, and continue the ſtate of affairs in the ſame condition that now it is, which is in few words extreamly Romiſh, Jeſuitiſh, and by conſequence <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mounſieur <hi>de Luine</hi> ſeemeth to me a man in himſelf capable of reaſon, and by the death of the Marſhal <hi>d'Anchre,</hi> eternally bound to be a good Patriot, but that he applyes himſelf wholly to the Kings perſon, and that diſtruſting his own judgment, relies upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Miniſters of the State, and principally
<note n="*" place="margin">Du Agen.</note> 
                  <hi>Du Augen</hi> the Chancellour, and the Gardeſeaux.</p>
               <p>They utterly neglect all the Alliances of our Religion abroad, and care not how inconſiderately they oppreſſe it at home. Onely they ſeem deſirous to entertain themſelves well with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the intervention of the <hi>Nunce,</hi> and do think that no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which they can give the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by this proceeding in other parts, can equal that which they pretend to receive at home, by ſuppreſſing the State, and doctrine of thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>If they proceed long in this train, it will undoubtedly breed miſchievous deſignes, which there is no ſo ready way to prevent, as to let them generally perceive, that they are diſcovered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the proceedings of the Miniſters of State will grow ſo deteſtable to all thoſe here, that have any ſenſe of the love of their Countrey, that it will produce either a change of their perſons, or of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe the departure of your Majeſtie doth not permit me to hope for the honour of ſeeing you, and that the advertiſements, and orders which I have to communicate unto you, do merit your ſpeedy review and magnanimous reſolution, I have preſumed to truſt them unto this paper, which I do humbly deſire may reſt in the hands of your Majeſtie alone.</p>
               <p>The treaty of reſtoring all that had been taken by Sea (which by a motion from <hi>Spain,</hi> was put into the hands of ſome Miniſters in <hi>Rome</hi>) is accompanied with ſo little hope of obtaining the end, that was pretended, that by reaſon of their continuing at <hi>Naples</hi> to diſſipate, and waſte ſuch goods as they had taken in our ſhips, and the Cardinal <hi>Borgias</hi> reſervedneſſe to promiſe any thing, that negotiation may be held as vain, and as an inſidious invention to gain time. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe my Maſters marching ſtill with a conſtant deſire of purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the publique tranquillity, have been content to render all ſuch veſſels as they had taken within their Gulph, in hope that having gotten the advantage of the cauſe by this honeſt proceeding, they might prevail in which they had made at <hi>Naples,</hi> for the reſtitution of their Galeaſſes, and of the ſhip called <hi>Roſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the actions and operations of the Spaniards do not anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what is deſired, and hoped. For in the Kingdome of <hi>Sicilie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> they do muſter new Souldiers, and they make great preparations for a war by the Sea. The ſubjects of thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are taxed with extraordinary Contributions of mony, and in daily councels held by the duke of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> the Marqueſſe <hi>Santa Croce,</hi> and other miniſters they do conſult of the meanes of making war, and doing hurt. But that which is moſt important is, that in the conjuncture, there is likewiſe in divers parts of <hi>Spain</hi> a terrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of great proviſions. For they have put in a readineſſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for 30000. men, they have ingroſſed all the ammunition that could be purchaſed, and have put in good equipage 60. tall ſhips which being added unto thoſe they have already in the Streights make 80. at <hi>Naples</hi> they have 20 ſhips more beſides all their own Gallies, and an order they have obtained for the Gallies of <hi>Malta, Florence,</hi> and the Pope to joyn with them.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers are quartered along the Coaſt of <hi>Apulia,</hi> which is oppoſite to our <hi>Gulphe,</hi> and they have 14000. foot of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:111544:111"/>French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> lodged within the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> In <hi>Flanders</hi> at this preſent, they make a new Leavie of 6000. foot, and a 1000. horſe. And in the ſtate of <hi>Millan,</hi> they do retain ſtill 3000. horſe ſupernumeraries. All which forces, and proviſions, as they do deſerve for their greatneſſe to be regarded, and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a jealous eye of every one; ſo thoſe, who do ſuffer at the preſent many injuries and acts of hoſtility at the hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and in particular the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> which is betrayed by their fraudulent treaties, cannot chuſe but fear, and doubt more then any other. Neither can any pretences of enterpriſes or deſigns againſt the Turk ſecure thoſe, who ſet the ſword bended againſt their breaſts, and the fire kindled in their own houſes.</p>
               <p>Whereupon your Majeſtie is humbly deſired that you will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider ſeriouſly of what hath been remonſtrated, and to take ſuch a reſolution, as may beſt befit your wiſdom, and Greatneſſe, and the ſafety, and indemnity of a State ſo obſervant of your Majeſty as ours is, and of a member ſo important of the liberty of <hi>Italie,</hi> and of Europe. There is not, at this day (Invincible Sir) any Prince in the whole world upon whom the Conſervation of the publique tranquillity doth more rely then upon your Majeſtie. For there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none that doth equal your Majeſtie in wiſdom, and experience, poſſeſſing your Kingdomes in perfect peace, quietneſſe, and plenty, to the infinite praiſe of your name, and being free from the moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſtormes and tempeſts, it ſeemeth that the eyes of all men are turned towards your Majeſtie as towards a Sun, that ought to clear the Skie, and that they expect deliverance onely from your hand. Theſe reſolutions (oh moſt wiſe King) will be the ſtrongeſt walls upon which your eternity can be reared. Theſe will be the Jewels, and the crown, which will adorn you in earth, and in Heaven. Theſe will be the immortal Glorie of your powerful name.</p>
               <p>The reſolutions in caſes of ſuch weight, and danger ought to be magnanimous, quick, and powerful. The very noiſe of your putting in order your royal Navie, the ſending a perſon of quality to the place, from whence the danger is feared, and the declaring your ſelf in favour of thoſe, whom you ſhall find to have the right on their ſide, may perhaps prove ſufficient to procure a peace. If words will not prevail deeds muſt follow, and ſuch a reſolution will prove the true Antidote to all their poyſons. For the better effecting whereof the world doth attend with great devotion to ſee a good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie renewed betwixt your Majeſtie and the <hi>French</hi> King; and for
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:111544:112"/>the diſpoſing your Majeſties heart thereunto, the State of <hi>Venice</hi> doth joyn her humble prayers unto the earneſt intreaty of many others.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, I am to requeſt your Majeſtie, that you will be pleaſed to forbid the exportation of Artillerie, ſhips and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners out of our Kingdomes for the ſervice of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it being neither juſt nor agreeable to your Majeſties Piety, that your Arms ſhould be ſtayned with the blood of a State, and Prince, that hath no equal in love to your Royal Crown, and that will ever teſtifie to all the world by effects of their obſervance, the pure, and ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion that they have to your Glorious name. For my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I humbly crave leave to kiſſe your royal hands.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I moſt humbly crave pardon of your Honour, if you do not receive my anſwer ſo ſoon as perhaps you might expect. For yours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtayed upon the way a month and a day, did not come to my hands until the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of Auguſt Stil. Vet.

My Lord of <hi>Doncaſter</hi> under whoſe Cover I received that Letter, did not think fit to ſend it to me by an expreſſe meſſenger for fear of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

                  </note> concerning my treating with 52. <hi>c.</hi> in favour of 93. <hi>a.</hi> having reference unto the inclination of 95. <hi>a.</hi> to peace, or the probability of defence to be made by 93. <hi>a.</hi> I held it more ſafe for me to govern my ſelf by ſuch informations of the ſtate of thoſe affairs as I have received from the favour of the 1. 32. 7. 5. 47. 48. 2. 10. 40. 45. of 51. <hi>a.</hi> in 97. <hi>a.</hi> And for the better juſtification of my proceedings, I ſend your Honour here incloſed the Copie of his Letter unto me, wherein you will ſee, that I have no reaſon as yet to ſpend the name of 51. <hi>a.</hi> in favour of 93. <hi>a.</hi> nor to imbargue 52. <hi>c.</hi> in a buſineſſe, which may draw a great charge, and envie upon himſelf, and not much advantage the 93. <hi>a.</hi> I muſt confeſſe that the 50. <hi>b.</hi> in general, and particularly the 54. <hi>b.</hi> and the 41. 45. 23. 34. 9. 12. of 5. 35. 22. 4. 30. 50. have repreſented the ſtate of thoſe affairs at this preſent unto 52. <hi>b.</hi> in a manner not onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the advertiſements ſent me, but almoſt contrary, and they do ſeem not only to be confident of the prevailing of 93. <hi>c.</hi> but likewiſe they continue to give hope that the 10. 51. 29. 15. of 48. 3. 59. 15. will concur with 51. <hi>b.</hi> and 52. <hi>b.</hi> in the 12. 30. 13. 9. 50. 27. 40. 35. of 99. <hi>a.</hi> But becauſe I have reaſon to ſuſpect that they make relation of thoſe affairs, rather as they wiſh they were, then as they be indeed, and that their intention to draw ſomewhat from 52. <hi>c.</hi> towards the ſuccours of 93. <hi>a.</hi> I will forbear to joyn with them therein, until I can have ſome better ground then their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, which may be thought to ſavour of partiality, and I have reaſon to be backward therein, becauſe I know that 52. <hi>c.</hi> would preſently take me <hi>eu mot,</hi> and put to the account of 51. <hi>a.</hi> that which he is moſt willing to do of himſelf. I do not affirm this out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, but upon good ground; for beſides, that he did ſignifie ſo much unto me at my return out of <hi>England,</hi> I do know that within this fortnight he hath ſent unto 56. <hi>b.</hi> 3000. 41. 24. 48. 49. 40. 30. 47. in part of 42, 2. 60, 32. 15. 35. 50. and in the conveyance of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:111544:113"/>this 33. 39. 34. 35. 61. there was extraordinary diligence uſed to conceal it from the knowledge of the 71. <hi>c.</hi> whereof no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can be made, but that 52. <hi>c.</hi> would fain be intreated by 71. <hi>c.</hi> to do that, which he hath already a mind to do.</p>
               <p>If upon more freſh Letters, which I expect from my Lord of <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> I ſhall find that the affairs there have changed face ſince the writing of his laſt unto me, I will govern my ſelf accordingly, as I ſhall receive warrant from him.</p>
               <p>We are here at a ſtand, expecting with devotion the iſſue of the affairs of <hi>Germanie.</hi> The Army in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> is ſtill retained, and no order given, either for the diſmiſſing of thoſe Troops, or the employing them in any ſervice. Prince <hi>Philibert</hi> is at <hi>Meſſina</hi> with the Gallies, and hath with him 10. or 12000 men. The Ships and Gallions remain at <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Walloons, Lombardes</hi> and <hi>Neapolitanes</hi> which ſhould have come to <hi>Vado,</hi> are ſince their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarquing again, quartered round the City of <hi>Naples.</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to gueſſe what they mean to do; but the moſt probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is, that under the colour of ſuſpecting the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will keep their potent Army on foot, and by that means keep all <hi>Italy</hi> in awe, and as it were <hi>ſub Ferulâ,</hi> and delude the reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated promiſes and oathes that have paſſed by them, to aſſure the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they would diſmiſſe thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The ſeaſon is now paſt for any enterpriſe by Sea, ſo that Prince <hi>Philibert</hi> muſt be forced to return without doing any thing. And many are of opinion, that the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> had ſecret order to counterfeit madneſſe, and to croſſe the Kings Commandement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely to deprive Prince <hi>Philibert</hi> of the honour which would have redounded unto him, if he had been poſſeſſed of the abſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſo potent an Armie. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> on the other ſide, would fain make you believe, that undoubtedly <hi>Oſſuna</hi> hath enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained rebellious thoughts, and that if <hi>Don Octavio D'Arragona</hi> do not bring a good anſwer out of <hi>Spain,</hi> he will break out into open contumacie. His demands of the King of Spain are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he may be continued in the Government four years longer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he may be permitted to enter with his Fleet into the Gulph of <hi>Venice,</hi> and to diſpute his Majeſties Title to that Sea by the force of Arms.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That in caſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will not let him Conteſt ſo far with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that there may then be ſent him ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of <hi>Spain</hi> as may licenſe his Army, conſidering that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:111544:113"/>of <hi>Naples</hi> is ſo far exhauſted, as that they cannot contribute any longer either to the maintaining, or to the diſmiſſing of thoſe Forces.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> did lately chaſe a ſmall Gallie of the <hi>Vicocchi,</hi> which was entred into the Gulph to rob and ſpoyl, and followed her unto the ſhoares of <hi>Apuglia,</hi> where <hi>Ferlitick</hi> the Captain of thoſe Thieves ſaved himſelf and the moſt part of his fellowes by flight into the mountains, but <hi>Signior Filippo Belegno</hi> recovered the Gallie, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her away as a prize, having found two banners diſplayed, the one with the arms of <hi>Spain,</hi> the other with the arms of <hi>Oſſuna;</hi> And not onely a formal Patent and Commiſſion to take any thing, that he could from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but ſome Letters likewiſe from ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Miniſters of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> wherein this <hi>Capo di Banditi</hi> is encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and requeſted to do the <hi>Venetians</hi> as much hurt and dammage, as he might be able. Now the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> is fallen into a great rage with the <hi>Venetians, quod non totum telum corpore acceperunt,</hi> and he doth threaten to be revenged upon them for not ſuffering theſe <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocchie</hi> to rob and ſpoyl their ſubjects.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> hath done me the honour to intreat my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him into <hi>Savoy,</hi> whither he doth purpoſe very ſhortly to go, that he may receive at the confines of his eſtate, the Prince of <hi>Piedmount,</hi> and Madam his wife. And becauſe his requeſt hath the power of a command over me in <hi>Licitis, et honeſtis,,</hi> I muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to paſſe the Mountaines again at an unſeaſonable time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſufficiently refreſhed my ſelf after my laſt voyage, and I know not whether I ſhall have the opportunity of writing unto your Honour again before my going, which is uncertain, as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the going of the Duke.

               <p>I Have received the Letter, wherewith your Honour hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to favour me, dated at <hi>White-Hall</hi> the 27. of February, and having to my ſingular comfort underſtood, that his Majeſtie hath declared his gracious approbation of my proceedings here, with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians.</hi> And I do with all thankfulneſſe acknowledge to receive that favour from the hand of your Honour, as my only <hi>Gratum faciens</hi>—</p>
               <p>I will not fail to govern my ſelf preciſely by the rule of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which you have been pleaſed to give me. And as you have favoured me with paſſing your word for me, that I will not ſpend his Majeſties name without particular Warrant, and direction; ſo will I promiſe faithfully to perform as much, as you have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for me, and both in this, as in all things elſe you may aſſure your ſelf, that his Majeſties revealed will, and that only, ſhall be a Law unto me.</p>
               <p>Your Honour will have underſtood by my former Diſpatches, that the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> is re-confirmed in his Government of <hi>Naples:</hi> He hath not (as far as I can learn) any certain time prefixed, but is to remain there <hi>durante Regis bene—placito;</hi> And when his Patent was preſented unto him, he had likewiſe order (which was delivered by word of mouth) that the King his Maſter did require him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to diſmiſſe all his Army, and to ſend the <hi>Walloons,</hi> and <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> to the ſuccours of the Emperour. The ſame party did likewiſe ſignifie unto him, that as the King of Spain had ſhewed, to have a care of the honour of the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing him anew in that Regencie, at this time, when the world had made ſome doubt, that his late actions had not been conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will and pleaſure of his Maſter, ſo he did expect that he ſhould voluntarily, and of himſelf, ask leave to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> and offer to give an account of all his proceedings. Which courſe, the King did recommend unto him as moſt honourable, for the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own innocencie, and the confuſion of his enemies. This Meſſage the ſaid Duke hath wiſely ſuppreſſed, and hath publiſhed the Patent of his Confirmation, without taking notice of the private Articles, which were annexed thereunto, and delivered verbally. He doth profeſſe to underſtand very well, that in <hi>Spain</hi> they wiſh him ill, and that their deſign is under the fair bait of this eſtabliſhing him in that Government, to make him ſwallow the hook of diſmiſſing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:111544:114"/>his armie, that ſo they may afterwards diſpoſe of him at their pleaſure, when he hall remain utterly diſarmed. But his heart did not ſerve him to throw away the ſcabbard when he had drawn his ſword: and I am perſwaded, that as in <hi>Spain</hi> they will judge of his proceedings by the rule of <hi>Tacitus. Qui deliberant deſciverant:</hi> ſo he will repent of not having obſerved, that other <hi>Maxime, Aut nunquam tentes, Aut perfice.</hi> His beſt hope is, that <hi>Chi ha tempo ha vita,</hi> and if he can make his peace at home upon any conditions, he will not much care to turn honeſt, and change his dangerous deſigns into faithful ſervice of his Maſter. To play <hi>Le bon valett,</hi> he hath now obeyed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Commandment in ſending the <hi>Walloons</hi> and <hi>Nepolitans</hi> into <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardie,</hi> and they are all ſo ſafely arrived at <hi>Vado</hi> upon 19. Gallions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in number 6. or 7000,</p>
               <p>The landing of theſe troops, and their paſſing along the skirt of this State doth not onely give a little jealouſie to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but put him likewiſe to ſome Coſt, and trouble. For as he doth well know, how dangerous it is to ſtand to the diſcretion of a reconciled enemy, ſo doth he evidently ſee, that their ill talent towards him, doth not only continue, but increaſe; and therefore to aſſure himſelf, and his State, he hath cauſed at this preſent a general muſter to be made of all his Cavallarie, and trained Infanterie, which he doth ſend to the confines of his State, that way, which theſe newly landed Troops are to paſſe. And although their order be to march towards <hi>Swiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to paſſe that way into <hi>Germany,</hi> yet will this Prince ſtand upon his guard until they are quite gone out of <hi>Lombardie,</hi> and hath given order to the Count <hi>Guido</hi> St. <hi>George</hi> in his abſence, not to let him lodge in <hi>Monferrat</hi> upon any terms whatſoever, nor to linger too long neer the Confine of this Province. He hath this reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wiſh him ill, becauſe he doth ſee that they do miſtruſt him. For wheras they had a fair promiſe of the paſſage for their armie through this State, in vertue of antient capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betwixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen rather to buy the paſſage at the hands of the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> at a very dear rate, then adventure to take it here <hi>Gratis.</hi> Whereby it may appear unto all the world how little confidence they have in this Prince, and how much they miſtruſt him for being partiallie affected to the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> and all that party. Howſoever your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour doth conceive, that the ſeaſon of the year is too far paſſed for the tranſportation of this army of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> yet you will ſee that neceſſity doth make men ſtrive with many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:111544:115"/>for they muſt paſſe whatſoever weather happen; and indeed the Alpes are paſſable enough until the months of January and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, if the Souldiers be well cloathed, for there is no danger but of cold, untill the deluges of Snow which fall late do ſhut up the paſſages.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they will not find the paſſages of <hi>Suiſſerland</hi> ſo favourable as they do conceive, and as is figured unto them, for they have bought it only of the little Popiſh <hi>Cantons,</hi> without asking leave of the <hi>Seigniorie</hi> of <hi>Zurich,</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> and it is to be ſuppoſed, that the State of <hi>Berne</hi> will take a hot Alarum, conſidering that their controverſie with <hi>Friburge</hi> is not accommodated, and that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Millan</hi> hath made offer unto thoſe of <hi>Friburge,</hi> and the little <hi>Cantons,</hi> of all this armie for the defence of the Catholique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the <hi>Bailiage</hi> of <hi>Eſchalens,</hi> whereof I have given notice to our <hi>Signiorie</hi> of <hi>Berne</hi> by an expreſſe Currier that they may have time to ſave themſelues from a ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>The voyce doth run currant over all <hi>Italie,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> is to undertake a voyage ſhortly for the ſervice of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but whither he is to go they cannot tell; for ſome ſend him into <hi>Germanie,</hi> others into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the moſt men into <hi>Spain.</hi> For all which diſcourſe, I know no other ground, but that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> hath asked leave of the Pope to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a time to <hi>Parma,</hi> and I do imagin that the <hi>Speculativi</hi> have concluded thereupon, that he is to govern the State in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his brother.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Philibert</hi> having failed of the enterpriſe of <hi>Suſa,</hi> did intend in his ſcond ſetting out from <hi>Sicily,</hi> to meet with the Turkiſh Fleet and fight with them. The firſt part of his deſign ſucceeded happily, for he had the good fortune to encounter the whole Fleet between <hi>Zant</hi> and <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> but finding them more ſtrong then he was aware, and well reſolved to give him battaile, he was counſailed to retire to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where he is at this preſent, without having effected any thing. The two armies of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Turk, did likewiſe meet on thoſe Seas, not far from <hi>Corfu,</hi> but as ſoon as they did know each the other, the two Generals, and all the principal Officers, did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably preſent one the other with wine, and <hi>Rinfres Camenti,</hi> and ſo much kindneſſe paſſed betwixt them, that the <hi>Viſier Baſſa</hi> did offer to joyn his Fleet with the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and to ſet upon the Spaniſh <hi>Armado,</hi> which charitable offer, the <hi>Venetian</hi> General had ſo much chriſtianity as to refuſe with modeſt thanks.</p>

               <p>Signiour <hi>Autonio Donato</hi> hath ſent a ſervant of his hither, who had the fortune to arrive in an ill Conjuncture. For the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having lately called upon the <hi>Venetians</hi> for that money which is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Signiour <hi>Donato</hi>'s account, they did excuſe themſelves upon his pleading not guilty, and did ſend unto the Duke a Copy of his Letter written to the Senate, when he was yet Embaſſadour, and not convicted. This Letter arrived here from <hi>Venice</hi> the very day before Signiour <hi>Donato's</hi> ſervant, and if your Honour will be pleaſed to caſt an eye upon the Copy which I ſend here incloſed, you will not blame the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for refuſing to give him audience, or to receive his Maſters Letters; for he doth give the Duke the Lie three ſeveral times in that Letter, which is ſtrange language to be uſed of a Prince; and I do much wonder, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> would upon any occaſion whatſoever publiſh ſuch a Petulancie, committed by one, that was their Embaſſadour at that time.</p>
               <p>He brought me a Letter from his Maſter of meer Ceremonie, and Complement, and had his principal addreſſe unto the Popes Nuntio in this Court, whereat I did wonder ſomewhat formally at the firſt, as conceiving that in Congruity he ought to have interrupted his Correſpondence with the Popes Miniſters, as long as he doth live under the protection of his Majeſtie; but when I underſtood, that the Duke had lodged him in a priſon, with an intent to ſend him to <hi>Venice,</hi> I was glad that I had ſo little to do with him, and the Nuntio ſo much.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> doth aſſure himſelf, that when his Majeſtie ſhall have peruſed this Letter of Signiour <hi>Donato's,</hi> he will withdraw his countenance, and protection from him, and account him unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any favour, for having wronged in ſo high a degree a Prince, that is ſo much a ſervant of his Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>I may not likewiſe conceal from his Majeſties knowledge, that Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour <hi>Donato</hi> hath not been wanting to ruine (as far as he could) <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentio</hi> in <hi>Venice;</hi> two perſons that have done his Majeſtie very long and faithful ſervice, as by an incloſed Paper, your Honour may ſee, which is an abſtract of a Letter written from <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> having made a poſting voyage hither to receive his Fathers bleſſing, before he bring his Lady in the Country, I did preſent unto him his Majeſties Letters of Congratulation, whereunto he hath returned an anſwer, which I ſend here incloſed.

               <p>In the State of <hi>Millan</hi> likewiſe ſome inſurrections were beginning to be made in <hi>Novarra, Alleſſandria,</hi> and <hi>Cremona,</hi> both for want of bread, and for the inſolencie of the Garriſon Souldiers, who having had no pay for many moneths, did commit many violent exceſſes upon the people, which did drive them into deſpair; but thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions were appeaſed betimes, and no great matter of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath enſued, although there are ſome neighbour Princes who did ſtand <hi>aux Eſcoutes,</hi> and would be ready to have acted a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome part, if the ſcene had been ready.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> hath impriſoned his natural ſon <hi>Don Octavie,</hi> the myſterie whereof is not well known, but it muſt needs be for ſome great matter, becauſe he did make ſhew to love him paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

The <hi>Auſtriaci</hi> were never ſo matched as with Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> for he is a perpetual motion, and doth not ſtand upon the defenſive (as others have done hitherto, and loſt by the bargain) but he is alwaies ſetting upon them, and doth make War at their coſt; let them take heed how they proceed with him; for he, who hath nothing to loſe, is ready to hazard the Paquet upon all occaſions; And if he do chance to overthrow them once in battel, they will run danger, or loſe all that they have in <hi>Germany.</hi> Let me in all humility beſeech your Lordſhip to continue me in the honor of your good opinion, and to favour me with your honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, eſpecially with a good word to my Lord Treaſurer, for the ſending me ſome relief, without which I cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for want of my pay, conſumed all that I had in the world.

               <p>IT ſeemeth that the Glorie of this State, which at all times was great doth ſhine brighter now adayes; ſince that beſides ſo many Neighbouring Kings and Princes, whereof ſome are in a made league with us, and ſome do keep a good correſpondence, and all a good intelligence with us. Now the friendſhip of your Highneſſe is ſought by the mighty King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> a monarch of thoſe nations, that in time paſt have left their remembrance of their <hi>proweſſe</hi> in <hi>Italie. France, Spain,</hi> and in whole Europe behind them. This Great King of the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th, who like a Second <hi>Atlas</hi> holds up the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick-pole,</hi> rich in treaſure, numerous in men, dreadful for his invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble generoſity and Courage, doth here offer himſelf unto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And acquainting you of his actions, doth confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you to ſtand firm, and ſtout in the defence of the common cauſe, if ſo be that he receive that aſſiſtance as he hath reaſon to expect from thoſe, that are intereſted in the ſame cauſe. His Majeſtie of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath had from the King my Maſter, as much as can be given, and it is no ſmall matter, that his Majeſtie of great <hi>Brittain</hi> doth ſtill continue the ſame aſſiſtance, having withall ſtill thoſe great expences, that are required for the ſurety of his Realmes, and for the offence of the common enemie.</p>
               <p>His Majeſtie of <hi>France</hi> hath alſo contributed to this good work ſomewhat, and there is great hope, that he will bring forth in a ſhort time ſome fit remedie againſt this evill. The Lords States do as much as they are able. And the Princes of <hi>Low Saxonie</hi> do not want in their duties. There remaineth now, that your Highneſſe put alſo your powerful hand to this work, and with a vigorous ſuccour, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of your great heart do incourage all the reſt to continue their Empreſe. The two Kings are not ignorant of the great ſincerity wherewith this moſt Excellent State, doth obſerve the capitulations made with Allies of the league, and that rather then to be wanting in things agreed upon, you have ſurpaſſed in neceſſarie proviſions for the advancement of the deſigns, and that you have not been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, nor agreers of the treaty made at <hi>Moncon.</hi> But that you do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to keep ſome forces in your Dominions, and likewiſe ſome troops in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> for the effecting (as much as is in you) of what was firſt thought fit, and of the agreement of the League.</p>
               <p>And as that generous reſolution and conſtancie of this State is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough praiſed, ſo there is great hope that you will not bring this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:111544:117"/>ſame in the reckoning of the two Kings, who never will miſſe to praiſe the wiſdome and generoſitie of this State, though not obliged for their particular for any thing whatſoever done till now, either by the league in general, or by whomſoever of the united in particular, becauſe that the league was made two years and more before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie of great <hi>Brittain</hi> broke with <hi>Spain,</hi> or that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had declared himſelf. Since the time that theſe two Kings are come to the <hi>Dance,</hi> your Highneſſe hath not levied one man, and the Forces which you do yet keep, as they were not levied, ſo are they not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Contemplation of the two Kings, but onely for the firſt reaſons of the League.</p>
               <p>The onely thing here ſought for is to go with a common pace, that thoſe that are now too heavily laden, may be ſupported by their friends, either by way of diverſion, or by way of aſſiſtance. And therefore your Highneſſe and other Princes are now requeſted to help, ſeeing there is ſmall appearance of diverſion. And ſet the caſe, that the Peace between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> ſhould be firm, would it not turn againſt the Common Cauſe? <hi>Italiae incendium ruina Germaniae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguere?</hi> To quench a little fire in <hi>Italy</hi> by the ruine of whole <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many?</hi> In Chronical diſeaſes Phyſitians do not ſo much reſpect the ſymptomes and accidents as they do the cauſes of the evil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Valtoline, Palatinate, Huſſia, Marchiſat</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> Dukedome of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and ſo many other Countries attempted, and oppreſſed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Auſtrian</hi> uſurpation, are grievous and dangerous ſymptomes and accidents: but the Cauſe, and fewel of the evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains yet in the ambitious bowels of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who now with ſpread ſailes goeth on towards the univerſal Monarchie; unleſſe there be applied betimes ſome fit remedies, all topick remedies will do but little good.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> doth offer himſelf ready to apply ſuch an iſſue, whereby he may be brought back to terms of modeſtie, and with the aſſiſtance he doth expect from your Highneſſe and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed Princes, he hopeth to bring his good intent to paſſe. And being prodigal of his great Soul, there is no doubt he will ever go back, unleſſe he be forſaken.</p>
               <p>Thus there remains the Common liberty almoſt in your hands, and if this moſt excellent Senate reſolves to give ayd unto that King, that libertie will be preſerved. If you do forſake him, that will alſo be indangered, yea loſt. I therefore beſeech your Highneſſe to ponder well this matter, and to grant ſuch an aſſiſtance, as is requeſted by the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Embaſſadour.</p>

               <p>I did viſit the ſaid Embaſſadour immediatly at my return from the King, and ſaluted him as by expreſſe Commandment; interjecting ſome words of mine own gladneſſe, that he had received content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this tender point, which would ſignalize his beginnings. This I ſaid, becauſe in truth I had found him alwaies before the more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate in it by ſome reflection upon himſelf. His anſwer (after due thanks for his Majeſties gracious remembrance of him from abroad) was, That for his own part, he was <hi>Contentiſſimo,</hi> and had repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things home in the beſt manner. He hoped likewiſe it would be well taſted there alſo, though with ſome doubt, becauſe the State out of their own devotion towards his Majeſtie might form a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of expecting more. I replyed, that the King upon the matter (if we conſider diſgrace) had done more then themſelves: for he was but once baniſhed at <hi>Venice,</hi> and twice here; <hi>viz.</hi> once from the Verge of the Court, and ſecondly, from <hi>London,</hi> which was as much as could be done with preſervation of National immunities, and more then would have been done at the ſuit of any other Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour here reſident, or perhaps of any of their own hereafter if the like caſe ſhall occur. For (as I told him) it was the Kings expreſſe will, that his particular reſpect to the republique, and to him in this buſineſſe ſhould not be drawn into examples. With this point he was not a little pleaſed for his own glory, and ſaid, that indeed Mr. Secretarie <hi>Nanton</hi> had told him ſo. This was the ſumme of what paſſed between us, omitting impertinencies. Let me end (my dear Lord) as I am bound in all the uſe, either of my pen, or of my voice, with an humble and hearty acknowledgment of my great obligations towards your Lordſhip, which will make me reſolve, and in good faith unhappy, till I can ſome way ſhew my ſelf</p>

               <p>In anſwer of which Letter after ſome reſpite from mine own evils, I have deputed my ſaid Nephew to redeliver my fortune into your Noble hands, and to aſſure your Lordſhip, that as it ſhould be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpent at your Command if it were preſent and actual (from whoſe mediation I have derived it) ſo much more am I bound to yeeld up unto your Lordſhip an abſolute diſpoſition of my hopes: But if it ſhould pleaſe you therein to grant me any part of mine own humour, then I would rather wiſh ſome other ſatisfaction, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Office; yet even in this point likewiſe ſhall depend on your will, which your Lordſhip may indeed challenge from me, not onely by an humble gratitude, and reverence due to your moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon, but even by that natural charity and diſcretion, which I owe my ſelf: For what do I more therein, then onely remit to your own arbitrement the valuation of your own goodneſſe? I have likewiſe committed to my foreſaid Nephew ſome Memorials touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Lordſhips familiar ſervice (as I may term it) in matter of art and delight.</p>
               <p>But though I have laid theſe Offices upon another, yet I joy with mine own pen to give your Lordſhip an account of a Gentleman, worthier of your love, then I was of the honour to receive him from you.</p>
               <p>We are now after his well-ſpent travailes in the Townes of purer language, married again till a ſecond Divorce, for which I ſhall be ſorry, whenſoever it ſhall happen. For in truth (my good Lord) his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:111544:119"/>converſation is both delightful, and fruitful, and I dare pronounce, that he will return to his friends, as well fraught with the beſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations as any that hath ever ſifted this Countrie, which indeed doth need ſiſting; for there is both flower and bran in it.</p>
               <p>He hath divided his abode between <hi>Sienna</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> The reſt of his time was for the moſt part ſpent in motion. I think his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be to take the French tongue in his way homewards, but I am perſwading with him to make <hi>Bruxels</hi> his Seat, both becauſe the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Languages are familliar there, whereof the one will be after <hi>Italian</hi> a ſport unto him, ſo as he may make the other a labour: And for that the ſaid Town is now the ſcene of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Treatie, which I fear will laſt till he come thither: but far be from me all ominous conceit.</p>
               <p>I will end with cheerful thoughts and wiſhes; beſeeching the Almighty God to preſerve your Lordſhip in health, and to cure the publique diſeaſes. And ſo I ever remain</p>

                  <salute>My moſt honoured, and dear Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>TO give your Lordſhip occaſion to exreciſe your Noble nature, is withal one of the beſt exerciſes of mine own duty and therefore I am conſident to paſſe a very charitable motion through your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips hands, and mediation to his Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>There hath long lay in the priſon of Inquiſition a conſtant worthy Gentleman, viz. Mr. <hi>Mole;</hi> In whom his Majeſtie hath not only a right as his ſubject, but likewiſe a particular intereſt in the cauſe of his firſt impriſonment. For having communicated his Majeſties immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal work touching the alleagiance due unto Soveraign Princes with a <hi>Florentine</hi> of his familiar acquaintance, this man took ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at ſome paſſages, as troubling his conſcience, he took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at next ſhrift to confer certain doubts with his Confeſſor, who
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:111544:119"/>out of malitious curioſity, enquiring all circumſtances, gave after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards notice thereof to <hi>Rome,</hi> whither the ſaid <hi>Mole</hi> was gone with my Lord <hi>Roſſe,</hi> who in this ſtorie is not without blame; but I will not disquiet his Grave.</p>
               <p>Now having lately heard, that his Majeſtie at the ſuite of I know not what Embaſſadours (but the <hi>Florentine</hi> amongſt them is voiced for one) was pleaſed to yield ſome releaſement to certain reſtrained perſons of the Roman faith: I have taken a conceit upon it, that in exchange of his clemencie therein, the Great Duke would be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily moved by the Kings Gracious requeſt, to intercede with the Pope for Mr. <hi>Moles</hi> delivery. To which purpoſe if it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſtie to grant his Royal Letters, I will ſee the buſineſſe duely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. And ſo needing no arguments to commend this propoſition to his Majeſties goodneſſe, but his goodneſſe it ſelf, I leave it (as I began) in your Noble hand.</p>
               <p>Now touching your Lordſhips familiar ſervice (as I may term it) I have ſent the complement of your bargain upon the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and beſt manned ſhip, that hath been here in long time, called the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and indeed the cauſe of their long ſtay hath been for ſome ſuch ſure veſſel as I might truſt. About which ſince I wrote laſt to your Lordſhip, I reſolved to fall back to my firſt choice. So as now the one peece is the work of <hi>Titian,</hi> wherein the leaſt figure (viz the child in the Virgins lap playing with a bird) is alone worth the price of your expence for all four, being ſo round, that I know not whether I ſhall call it a piece of ſculpture, or picture; and ſo lively, that a man would be tempted to doubt, whether nature, or art had made it. The other is of <hi>Palma,</hi> and this I call the ſpeaking piece, as your Lordſhip will ſay it may well be tearmed: for except the Damoſel brought to <hi>David,</hi> whom a ſilent modeſty did beſt become, all the other figures are in diſcourſe, and action. They come both diſtended in their frames; for I durſt not hazard them in rowles, the youngeſt being 25. yeares old, and therefore no longer ſupple, and pliant. With them I have been bold to ſend a diſh of Grapes to your Noble Siſter, the Counteſſe of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> preſenting them firſt to your Lordſhips view, that you may be pleaſed to paſſe your cenſure, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Italians</hi> can make fruits as well as <hi>Flemmings,</hi> which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Glorie of their pencils. By this Gentleman, I have ſent the choiceſt Melon ſeeds of all kinds, which his Majeſtie doth expect, as I had order both from my Lord of <hi>Holderneſſe,</hi> and from Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert.</hi> And although in my Letter to his Majeſtie (which I hope by your Lordſhips favour himſelf ſhall have the honour to deliver
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:111544:120"/>together with the ſaid ſeeds) I have done him right in his due attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; yet let me ſay of him farther as <hi>Architects</hi> uſe to ſpeake of a well choſen foundation, that your Lordſhip nay boldly builde what fortune you pleaſe upon him, for ſurely he will bear it virtuouſly. I have committed to him for the laſt place a private memorial touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf, wherein I ſhall humbly beg your Lordſhips interceſſion upon a neceſſarie motive.

               <p>In ſhort, it is only an image of your ſelf drawn by memorie from ſuch diſcourſe as I have taken up here and there of your Lordſhip among the moſt intelligent, and unmalignant men. Which to por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict before you, I thought no ſervile office, but ingenious and real. And I could wiſh, that it had come at that day, that ſo your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might have begun the new year ſomewhat like <hi>Platos</hi> definition of felicity with the contemplation of your own <hi>Idea.</hi> They ſay, that in your forraign imployments under King <hi>James</hi> your Lordſhip wan the the opinion of a very able and ſearching judgment, having been the firſt diſcoverer of the intentions againſt the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which were then in brewing, and maſqued with much art, and that Sir <hi>Edward Conway</hi> got the Start of you both in title, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> wanted then for his own ends a Martial Secretarie.</p>
               <p>They ſay that under our preſent Soveraign you were choſen to the higheſt charge at the loweſt of the State, when ſome inſtrument was requiſite of indubitable integrity, and provident moderation, which atributes I have heard none deny you.</p>
               <p>They diſcourſe thus of your actions, ſince, that though great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtations cannot be cured without ſuddain remedies no more in a Kingdom then in a natural body: yet your Lordſhip hath well allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe bluſtring clamours, wherewith at your beginning, your houſe was in a manner daily beſieged.</p>
               <p>They note, that there hath been made changes, but that none hath brought to the place a judgment ſo cultivated, and illuminated with various erudition as your Lordſhip, ſince the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom they make your paralel in the ornament of knowledg.</p>
               <p>They obſerve in your Lordſhips divers remarkable combinations of virtues and abilityes rarely ſociable.</p>
               <p>In the character of your aſpect, a mixture of Authority, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie. In the faculties of your mind quick apprehenſion and ſolidity together, in the ſtile of your Porte, and Trayn, as much dignity and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:111544:121"/>as great dependencie as was ever in any of your place, and with little noiſe, and outward form.</p>
               <p>That your Table is very abundant, free, and noble, without Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; That you are by nature no flatterer, and yet of greateſt power in Court. That you love magnificence and frugality both together. That you entertain your Gueſts and Viſitours with noble Courteſie, and voyd of Complement. Laſtly, that you maintain a due regard to your perſon and place, and yet no enemy to froath-formalities.</p>
               <p>Now in the diſcharge of your function, they ſpeak of two things that have done you much honour, <hi>viz.</hi> that you had alwaies a ſpecial care to the ſupply of the Navie; And likewiſe a more worthy and tender reſpect towards the Kings only ſiſter for the continual ſupport from hence, then ſhe hath found before.</p>
               <p>They obſerve your Greatneſſe as firmly eſtabliſhed as ever was any, of the love (and which is more) in the eſtimation of a King who hath ſo ſignalized his Conſtancie: beſides your additions of ſtrength (or at leaſt of luſtre) by the nobleſt alliances of the Land.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe notes, it is no wonder if ſome obſerve, that between a good willingneſſe in your affections to ſatisfie all, and impoſſibility in the matter, and yet an importunity in the perſons, there doth now and then, I know not how, ariſe a little impatience, which muſt needs fall on your Lordſhip, unleſſe you had been cut out of a Rock of Diamonds, eſpecially having been long before ſo converſant with liberal ſtudies, and with the freedom of your own mind.</p>
               <p>Now after this ſhort Collection touching your moſt honoured Perſon, I beſeech you give me leave to adde likewiſe a little what men ſay of the Writer.</p>
               <p>They ſay I want not your gracious good will towards me, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the degrees of my poor talent, and Travailes; but they ſay, I am wanting to my ſelf. And in good faith (my Lord) in ſaying ſo, they ſay the truth. For I am condemned I know not how by nature to a kind of unfortunate baſhfulneſſe in mine own buſineſſe, and it is now too late to put me in a new Furnace.</p>
               <p>Therefore, It muſt be your Lordſhips proper work, and not onely your Noble, but even your charitable goodneſſe, that muſt in ſome bleſſed hour remember me. God give your Lordſhip many healthful and joyful years, and the bleſſing of that Text <hi>Beatus qui attendit ad attenuatum.</hi> And ſo I remain with all humble and willing heart</p>

               <p>I have almoſt in all my Diſpatches ſince we entred into this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſignified what opinion I had of their proceedings here, and my chief comfort was, that whatſoever the ſucceſſe were, that the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Majeſties intentions would appear to the whole world, and that the failing is not of his ſide, which I think is manifeſt enough: for notwithſtanding that his Majeſtie hath followed them in all their deſires, and the Prince Electour hath conformed himſelf to what was demanded, that the Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick,</hi> the pretended obſtacles of the Treatie, are now with all their Forces removed.

               <p>I Have according to his Majeſties Command ſignified to me by Mr. Secretarie <hi>Conway,</hi> delivered to the Earl of <hi>Middleſex</hi> his Majeſties pleaſure concerning his Fine. The news of it did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſmay him, as being far contrary to his expectation. He uſed not many words; but thereof I having given Mr. Secretarie a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account in anſwer of the charge I received from his Majeſtie, I will not trouble your Grace with the repetition of them.</p>
               <p>The chief cauſe of this unto your Grace is, to acquaint your Grace with a ſhort Dialogue that paſſed between Mr. <hi>Brett</hi> and me touching his Penſion.</p>
               <p>He ſent his man to me this week to demand it; to whom I made this anſwer, That the charge of the Progreſſe being ſettled, I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the payment of his Maſters penſion amongſt others, before which time I could not in that caſe give ſatisfaction to any. He went away with this anſwer, and immediately after (within leſs then a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour) Mr. <hi>Brett</hi> himſelf came to me, and asked me at the firſt word, Whether I had any Command to ſtay his Penſion. I replied, No other command then the want of money. He told me, That the reſt of his fellowes were paid: I ſaid it was true, I was to have care of them that immediately followed his Majeſtie, when I was forced to intreat others to have patience till more moneyes came in. He asked me again. Whether I had any Command to ſtay his? I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>This peradventure is not worth troubling your Grace withal, but that becauſe his Majeſtie was pleaſed to acquaint me with his juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt him at <hi>VVanſteed,</hi> I would be glad to receive ſome direction, what anſwer I ſhall make upon his next importunitie.

               <p>MY laſt unto you was of the 23. of September by Mr. <hi>Berrie,</hi> who that day departed from hence towards England, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to take paſſage by Sea from <hi>St. Sebaſtians:</hi> and although I conceive, that this conveyance will be much ſpeedier (it being by an extraordinarie diſpatched for <hi>Flanders</hi>) yet for that I hold the other to be ſure, I will not forbear to trouble your Honour with any te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of that diſpatch.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength and boldneſſe of the Pyrats (or rather of the Turks) is now grown to that hieght both in the Ocean, &amp; <hi>Mediterranean</hi> ſeas, as I have never known any thing to have wrought a greater ſadneſſe and diſtraction in the Court, then the daily advice thereof. Their whole Fleet conſiſts of 40. Sail of tall ſhips, of between 200. and 400, tuns a piece; Their Admiral of 500. tuns. They are divided into 2. Squadrons, the one of 18. Sail remaining before <hi>Malaga</hi> (in ſight of the Citie) the other about the <hi>Cape St. Marie,</hi> which is between <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and <hi>Sevil.</hi> That Squadron within the <hi>Straights</hi> entred the rode of <hi>Mostil</hi> (a Town by <hi>Malaga</hi>) wherewith their ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they beat down a part of the Caſtle, and had doubtleſſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the town, but that from <hi>Granado</hi> there came Souldiers to ſuccor it; yet they took there divers ſhips, and amongſt them 3. or 4. of the weſt part of <hi>England.</hi> Two bigg Engliſh ſhips they drave on ſhoar, not paſt four Leagues from <hi>Malaga;</hi> and after they went on ſhoar alſo, and burnt them, and to this day they remain before <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga,</hi> intercepting all ſhips, that paſſe that way, and abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting all trade into thoſe parts of <hi>Spain.</hi> The other Squadron at the <hi>Cape St. Marie</hi> doth there the like, intercepting all ſhipping what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:111544:125"/>They lately met with ſeven fail of Engliſh ſhips, (all of London as I take it) but loaden only with pipeſtaves, which they had taken on the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the way. Five of theſe, viz. the <hi>Marie Anne,</hi> the <hi>Marie</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and <hi>Gibbs</hi> of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and one <hi>John Cheyney</hi> of London they took, and the other two eſcaped. They robb'd them onely of their victuals, their Ordnance, and of ſome ſayls, and ſo let them go, but in their company was alſo taken a great Ship of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> ſayd to be very rich, which they ſtill keep with all the men. They have few or no Chriſtians aboard them, but all either <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Moores,</hi> and the moſt part are of thoſe, which of late years were turned out of <hi>Spain</hi> for <hi>Moriſces.</hi> They attend (as it ſeems) and as themſelves report to them that have been aboard them (the coming of the <hi>Weſt Indian</hi> Fleet, which is now very near.) But from hence they have commanded the <hi>Armada</hi> (which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three Squadrons) to be joyned together, and advice is brought that it is ſo, and now conſiſts of twenty ſtrong ſhips; <hi>Don John Faxardo</hi> (the General) hath alſo expreſſe order to fight with the Pyrats, not admitting any excuſe whatſoever, but the common opinion is here, that we will be able to do them little harm, becauſe his ſhips are of great burthen, and they will be able to go from him at their pleaſure. And the other Squadron within the <hi>Straights</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be able to ſecure their retreat thither. I doubt not but in my next diſpatch, I ſhall be able to tell your Honour what <hi>Don John Fax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardo</hi> either hath or will do to them. If this year they ſafely return to <hi>Argier</hi> (eſpecially if they ſhould take any of the Fleet) it is much to be feared, that the King of <hi>Spains</hi> forces by Sea will not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to reſtrain, them hereafter, ſo much ſweetneſſe they find by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king prize of all Chriſtians whatſoever. The Secretary of the Councel of war, hath hereupon diſcourſed much unto me, and by him I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that here is an intention, to move his Majeſtie (the King our Maſter) that he will be pleaſed to joyn ſome of his Sea-forces (upon good terms) with this King, for the ſuppreſſing of theſe Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, if they ſhould hereafter grow, and increaſe as hitherto they have done. Seeing they now profeſſe themſelves the common enemies of Chriſtendom. Many reaſons he gave me, that he thought might move his Majeſtie thereunto; but that whereon for my part I moſt reflect is, that theſe courſes of the Pyrats, do but exerciſe the forces of the King of Spain by Sea, and put an obligation on him by all meanes to ſtrengthen, and increaſe his <hi>Armada,</hi> and keep in practiſe his Sea-ſouldiers, without doing him any great harm, for that the greateſt dammage will alwayes fall upon the Merchants that trade
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:111544:126"/>into thoſe parts (of which the Engliſh will ever be the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the greateſt loſers) And as for the taking of his Fleet, it is not to be imagined, for that beſides, that they come very ſtrong (conſiſting of 50 great ſhips, of which eight are Gallions of war) they ſhall alwayes be meet, and guarded by the <hi>Armada.</hi> Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may be pleaſed to acquaint his Majeſtie with what I here write, for I perceive it is expected, that I ſhould advertize what the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie hath diſcourſed to me, which I would have done more at large; but I am ſtraightned with want of time. Yet I may not forbear to advertize your Honour, that the ſaid Secretarie told me withal, that the laſt year the States deſired leave of this King for certain ſhips of war (which they had armed to Sea againſt <hi>Pyrats</hi>) might have ſafe recourſe into theſe parts, which was accordingly granted them, but that inſtead of offending the <hi>Pyrats,</hi> the ſame ſhips ſold in <hi>Argeir</hi> as much Powder, and other warlike proviſion (eſpecially powder) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Turks,</hi> as furniſhed the foreſaid Fleet which they have now at Sea, a thing which is here (he ſayes) very ill, taken. I doubt not but from <hi>Piemount</hi> your Honour hath better advertizement (at leaſt more ſpeedier) then I can give you from hence, yet have I thought it fit to advertize you, that in a late ambuſh, which the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> had layed, at <hi>Don Pedro de Tolledo's</hi> entrance into <hi>Piemount,</hi> the <hi>Maeſtro de Campo</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> armie was ſlain; the Son of the Prince of <hi>Aſloli</hi> was hurt: ſo was the Prince of <hi>Morveles</hi> (who ſerves this King there) and many other Captaines, and Gentlemen of note ſlain and hurt. They here ſay that the number of men <hi>Don Pedro</hi> loſt was but few, but their cuſtome is to diſſemble their loſſes, howſoever it is to be conceived, that when ſo many principal men were touched, the common Souldiers could not well eſcape.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Lisbone</hi> there is arrived two Caracks, and a Gallion from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the Caracks very rich, and much richer then in former years, but (as in a former Letter I advertiſed you) two others as rich as they, and that ſhould have come in company with theſe, were caſt away coming home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Roderigo Calderon</hi> (now the Marqueſſe <hi>de Las Siete Igleſias</hi>) is ſuddenly commanded from this Court, and confined to a ſmall Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and Judges are appointed to examine by what means he is ſo ſuddenly grown to ſo great an eſtate (which in my time is riſen from nothing to above 60000. Duckets a year rent, beſides an infinite treaſure in moveables) and doubtleſſe ſome heavie ſentence will fall upon him, for he hath many enemies, and I underſtand that the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> hath much withdrawn his favour.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:111544:126"/>
               <p>New ſupplies of Souldiers are here raiſed for the Governour of <hi>Millan,</hi> and 30. Companies are ready to be embarqued at <hi>Valentia,</hi> where the Gallies attend them.</p>
               <p>Here is lately come hither one who calls himſelf Sir <hi>James Macke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> a Scotchman, and ſayes he is Couſin german to the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile:</hi> I have not ſeen him, but I hear he diſcourſes of his breaking out of the Caſtle of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> of the unjuſtneſſe of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, of his integritie in the Popes Religion, and ſo deſires to be entertained into this Kings ſervice, which doubtleſſe he ſhall obtain if he can make it here be believed, that he hath a true fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives heart.</p>

Howbeit ſuch is the trouble of our mind for theſe calamitous diſcords and bloudſheds, which for theſe late years by paſt, have ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly rent the Chriſtian World, and ſo great is our care, and daily ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude to ſtop the courſe of theſe growing evils betimes, ſo much as in us lies, as we could no longer abſtain, conſidering that we all worſhip the ſame moſt bleſſed Trinitie, nor hope for ſalvation by any other means, then by the bloud and merits of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt Jeſus; but breaking this ſilence to move your Holineſſe by theſe our Letters friendly and ſeriouſly, that you would be pleaſed together with us to put your hand to ſo pious a work, and ſo worthy of a Chriſtian Prince.</p>
               <p>It is truly to be wiſhed, and by all means to be endeavoured, that this miſchief creep on no farther, but that theſe ſtorms at the laſt ceaſing, and the rancor being removed, by which they were at the firſt raiſed, the hearts of theſe Princes, whom it any way concerns, may be re-united in a firm and unchangeable friendſhip, and as much as may be knit together in ſtricter obligations then before, one unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>This we have alwaies had in our deſires, and to bring it to paſſe, have not hitherto ſpared any labour, or pains, not doubting but your Holineſſe out of your ſingular pietie, and for the credit and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that you have with the parties, both may and will further this work in an extraordinary manner. No way can any man better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the ſtate of Chriſtendome, which if it ſhall take the deſired effect in your daies, and by your aſſiſtance your Holineſſe ſhall worthily reap the glorie and the reward due to ſo excellent a work.</p>

               <p>GReat <hi>Brittain</hi> abounding with worthy men, and fertile virtues, ſo that the whole earth is full of the glorie of her renown, induceth many times the thoughts of the great Shepherd to the conſideration of her praiſes. In regard that preſently in the infancie of his Church, the King of kings vouchſafed to chooſe her with ſo great affection for his inheritance, that almoſt it ſeems there entred into her at the ſame time the Eagles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Standard, and the Enſigns of the Croſſe. And not few of her Kings indoctrinated in the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Salvation gave example of Chriſtian pietie to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and after-ages, preferring the Croſſe to the Scepter, and the defence of Religion to the deſire of Command. So that meriting heaven thereby (the Crown of eternal bliſſe) they obtained likewiſe upon earth the luſtre, and glorious ornaments of ſanctitie. But in this time of the <hi>Brittanicks</hi> Church, how much is the caſe altered? yet we ſee that to this day the Engliſh Court is fenced and guarded with moral virtues, which were ſufficient motives to induce us to love this Nation, it being ſome ornament to the Chriſtian name, if it were likewiſe a defence and ſanctuarie of Catholique virtues.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the more the glorie of your moſt Serene Father, and the property of your naturall diſpoſition delighteth us, the more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently we deſire, that the gates of Heaven ſhould be opened unto you, and that you ſhould purchaſe the univerſal love of the Church. For whereas, that the Biſhop <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great of moſt pious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie introduced amongſt the Engliſh people, and taught their Kings the Goſpel, and a reverence to the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Authority, we much inferiour to him in virtue, and ſanctity, as equal in name, and height of dignity, it is reaſon we ſhould follow his moſt holy ſteps, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:111544:128"/>procure the ſalvation of thoſe Kingdomes, eſpeciallie (moſt Serene Prince) there being great hopes offered to us at this time of ſome ſucceſſeful iſſue of your determination.</p>
               <p>Wherefore you having come to <hi>Spain</hi> and the Court of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique King, with deſire to match with the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> it ſeemed good to uſe moſt affectionatetly to commend this your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and to give clear teſtimony, that at this time your perſon is the moſt principal care that our Church hath. For ſeeing you pretend to match with a Catholique Damoſel, it may eaſily be preſumed, that the antient ſeed of Chriſtian pietie, which ſo happilie flouriſhed in the minds of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, may by Gods Grace reverberate in your breaſt. For it is not probable, that he, that deſires ſuch a wife, ſhould abhor the Catholique religion, and rejoyce at the overthrow of the holy <hi>Romane</hi> Church. To which purpoſe we have cauſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual prayers to be made, and moſt vigilant oriſons to the Father of Lights for you (fair flower of the Chriſtian world, and only hope of great <hi>Brittain</hi>) that he would bring you to the poſſeſſion of that moſt Noble inheritance, which your Anceſtors got you by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Apoſtolique authority, and deſtruction of monſters of haeriſies. Call to memorie the times of old; ask your forefathers, and they will ſhew you what way leades to heaven, and perceiving what path mortal Princes paſſe to the Heavenly Kingdom, behold the Gates of heaven open. Thoſe moſt holy Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which parting from <hi>Rome</hi> accompanied with Angels, moſt piouſly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced the Lord of Lords, and the Prince of the Apoſtles in his Chair. Their works and examples are mouthes wherewith God ſpeaks, and warneth you, that you ſhould imitate their cuſtomes in whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes you ſucceed.</p>
               <p>Can you ſuffer that they be called Heretiques, and condemned for wicked men, when the faith of the Church teſtifieth, that they reign with Chriſt in Heaven, and are exalted above all the Princes of the Earth, and that they at this time reached you their hands from that moſt bleſſed Country, and brought you ſafely to the Court of the Catholique King, and deſire to turn you to the womb of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church; wherein praying moſt humbly with moſt unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able groans to the God of mercy for your ſalvation, to reach you the arms of Apoſtolical charity to imbrace moſt lovingly your children, ſo often deſired, and to poynt out as it were with a finger the bleſſed hopes of Heaven. And truly you could do no act of greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all Nations of Chriſtendom, then to return the poſſeſſion of thoſe moſt Noble Iſles to the Prince of the Apoſtles, whoſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:111544:129"/>for ſo many ages was held in <hi>England</hi> for the defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and divine Oracle, which will not be uneaſie to do if you open your breaſt (upon which depends the proſperity of thoſe Kingdoms) to God who is knocking. And we have ſo great deſire of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and exaltation of your Royal Name, that we wiſh, that you ſhould be called through thee whole world (together with your moſt Serene Father) the Freer of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and reſtorer of her antient Religion. Whereof we will not loſe all hopes, putting them in mind in whoſe hands the hearts of Kings lie, and he that rules all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, by whoſe Grace we will with all poſſible diligence labour to effect it. And you cannot chooſe but acknowledge in theſe Letters the care of our Apoſtolical charity to procure your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which it will never repent us to have written, if the reading thereof ſhall at leaſtwiſe ſtir ſome ſparks of Catholique religion in the heart of ſo Great a Prince, who we deſire may injoy Eternal comfors, and flouriſh with the Glorie of all virtues.</p>

               <p>I Received the Diſpatch from your Holineſſe with great content, and with that reſpect which the pietie and care wherewith your, Holineſſe writes, doth require: It was an unſpeakable pleaſure to me to read the generous exploits of the Kings my predeceſſours, in whoſe memorie, poſterity hath not given thoſe praiſes and Elogies of honour as were due to them: I do believe that your Holineſſe hath ſet their examples before my eyes, to the end I might imitate them inall
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:111544:129"/>my actions, for in truth they have often expoſed their eſtates and lives for the exaltation of the holy Chair; and the courage with which they have aſſaulted the enemies of the Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, hath not been leſſe then the care and thought which I have, to the end that the peace and intelligence which hath hitherto been wanting in Chriſtendom, might be bound with a true and ſtrong concord: for as the common enemy of the peace watcheth alwaies to put hatred and diſſention amongſt Chriſtian Princes, ſo I believe that the glory of God requires that we ſhould endeavour to unite them: And I do not eſteem it a greater honour to be defcended from ſo great Princes, then to imitate them in the zeal of their piety. In which it helps me very much to have known the mind and will of our thrice honoured Lord and Father, and the holy intentions of his Catholique Majeſtie to give a happy concurrence to ſo laudable a deſign: for it grieves him exceedingly to ſee the great evils that grow from the diviſion of Chriſtian Princes, which the wiſdom of your Holineſſe foreſaw, when it judged the marriage which you pleaſed to deſign between the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta of <hi>Spain</hi> and my ſelf, to be neceſſary to proture ſo great a good; for 'tis very certain, that I ſhall never be ſo extreamly affectionate to any thing in the world, as to endeavour alliance with a Prince that hath the ſame apprehenſion of the true Religion with my ſelf: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intreat your Holineſſe to believe, that I have been alwaies very far from Novelties, or to be a partiſan of any faction againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, Apoſtolick Roman Religion: But on the contrary, I have ſought all occaſions to take away the ſuſpition that might reſt upon me, and that I will imploy my ſelf for the time to come, to have but one Religion and one Faith, ſeeing that we all believe in one Jeſus Chriſt. Having reſolved in my ſelf, to ſpare nothing that I have in the world, and to ſuffer all manner of diſcommodities, even to the hazarding of my eſtate and life, for a thing ſo pleaſing unto God: It reſts onely that I thank your Holineſſe, for the permiſſion you have been pleaſed to afford me, and I pray God to give you a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed health and his glory after ſo much pains which your Holineſſe takes in his Church.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:111544:131"/>them in the abſence of tht Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> An example certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unuſual with other Kings, and never to be taken in good part, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be perhaps, when the King himſelf wanting experience, and being of weak judgment and no wiſedom, ſome one, that is familiar, and inward with the King, a man wiſe and circumſpect, of great judgment and no leſſe experience, ſupplies the Kings place. But here, when all things go prepoſterouſly, and the King himſelf being a moſt prudent, and experienced Prince, he that is familiar, or favorite doth in all things ſhew himſelf, a raſh, headie young man, a Novice in managing of buſineſſe, and to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> moſt offenſive. Certainly by all juſt right, this man was to be kept away from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Embaſſadour of the State. We may alſo be bold to ſay, that his preſence ſo earneſtly deſired of him doth argue a great fear in him, and a great diſtruſt in him, as well of his own upright conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as alſo the Kings wiſdom. Hence therefore it is come to paſſe, that your Majeſties moſt faithful Vaſſals dare not ſo much as indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly diſcloſe their minds to the King, though they take it in very ill part, that a very good King ſhould be driven into ſuch ſtreights.

               <p>Beſides, who can without a diſcontented mind endure, that the greateſt affaires, and of greateſt moment (if any in the Chriſtian world can be ſo tearmed) ſhall be ordered, or concluded at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your Parliament, and from thence all things carried on with a headlong violence, at his will and pleaſure, and a moſt deadly war to be preferred before a moſt happie Peace. When as nevertheleſſe, I am not ignorant, that not ſo much the reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as the very claime to it, will very difficultly be obtained, or recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by force of armes. Let your Majeſtie exactly conſider as it uſeth to do, whether this be not an evident argument of that I have ſaid, that the conference, or treatie about the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was taken from the Councel of State, a ſociety of moſt prudent men, only forthis cauſe, that almoſt everie one of them, had with one conſent approved the propoſition of the moſt Catholique King, and did not find in it any cauſe of diſſolving that treaty. Hereupon the Parliament of this Kingdom was procured by the Duke, becauſe he thought his plots would be moſt acceptable to the Puritans, not without great injury to your Councel of State, from which he fled, and diſclaimed by way of an appeale, and with ſuch ſucceſſe, that we may be bold to ſay, that the Parliament is now above the King; Nay, which is more, that this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:111544:131"/>daring Duke propounded many things to the Parliament in the Kings name, your Majeſtie being neither acquainted with them nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to them. Yea and that he propounded many things contrary to your Majeſties ſervice. Who is there that doth not ſee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the royal diſpoſition of the Prince, adorned with ſo great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, of his mind, that he doth not in them all ſhew, and approve himſelf to be a very good ſon, of a very good King. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, that the Duke doth ſo much preſume upon his favour, that he contemneth all men, as knowing that thoſe, who are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Highneſſe, will alſo ſubject themſelves to his will. I would to God, he did direct thoſe his actions, to the good of the Prince. But that is a thing ſo far from the opinion of good men, that they rather believe, that he, who hath overthrown the marriage with <hi>Spain,</hi> will be of no leſſe power to the breaking of any other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and that is it which many do propheſie.</p>
               <p>They knew in <hi>Spain,</hi> that very ſame day, that he had received Letters from the moſt illuſtrious Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> that he cauſed the procuration to be revoked, and in a few dayes after, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the foreſaid Princes Secretarie, and the confirmation of his hope of having his Daughter married to her Highneſſe ſon, all things were utterly daſhed in pieces. Let your Majeſtie have a care of your ſelf, and the Prince, and foreſee the hurts, and damages, which a man of ſuch a turbulent humour may ſtir up; whoſe headie ſpirit your Majeſtie ſaith you have noted, and have deſired to mittigate.</p>
               <p>A man (I ſay) that is ambitious of popular ayr, as plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament, when the caſting of all odious matter upon your Majeſtie, he did arrogate the thanks of all things that were accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to himſelf, being ſtiled the redeemer of his countrie. I ſay again, a man that hath envied ſo great a good to the Chriſtian world, and principally to the kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> having uſed ſome certain meanes, which do argue, that he aymed at ſuch an end, as many already do fear, and to propheſie in it the worſt event that can be, if the Puritans deſire a kingdome (which they do againſt their wills) they wiſh it not to the moſt illuſtirous Prince, the beſt and true Heir of your Majeſtie, but to the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> whoſe ſpie and Scout <hi>Mansfelt</hi> is, what ſhew ſoever he makes. He that makes theſe things known to your Majeſtie diſchargeth the part of a good man, as well towards God, as your Majeſtie, and the illuſtirous Prince, whom it now ſtandeth in hand to foreſee the vengeance of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the Dukes plots, and the furie of the Parliament, there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo many, and ſo great teſtimonies publiſhed againſt <hi>Spain</hi> contrarie
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:111544:132"/>contrarie to truth, ſo many, and ſo frequent infamous Libels begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and brought forth, and many ſuch other things ſo full of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ignominie, that they cannot be read even of our enemies, without ſome taint upon the Engliſh Nation.</p>
               <p>It is moſtapparent, and ſtories will teſtifie, that here Leagues have been broken by the will and pleaſure of them, whom it eſpeciallie concerneth to provide for your peace, and quiet, and to wiſh from the bottom of their hearts, that after many, and theſe moſt happie, yeares, that Motto of yours (bleſſed be the Peace-makers) might be verified in Letter of the perſon of your Majeſtie, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſame Counſel to the moſt illuſtrious Prince to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which your Majeſtie hath done to the whole world to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and admired. A happie Prince will he be, if he comes, and ſuccceeds peaceably into the haereditarie poſſeſſion of his kingdom, and which will be of no leſſe advantage to him, having his peace eſtabliſhed with thoſe Princes, whoſe friendſhip and amitie your Majeſtie hath procured, and deſerved. He would certainly love and commend thoſe that had given him thoſe Counſels of peace. Peace and tranquillitie are by haereditarie right devolved to the moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Prince, in as much as he is born of the Father, who hath with ſo much induſtrie procured them, not onely to this Iſland, but to the continent alſo, eſteeming them at a higher value, then his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes themſelves.</p>
               <p>Which ſince it is thus, and that the blood of his Father, which is in him, and the love wherewith he is carried towards your Majeſtie, and the experience of this your moſt happie Government, and that great example wherewith your Majeſtie hath drawn, and won the Chriſtian world to an admiration, and love of you, did all direct the moſt illuſtrious Prince with a kind of connatural motion to the ſame Counſel, and purpoſe of peace, as might have heretofore been likewiſe hoped. Certainly this Machination is very ſtrong, violent, and mighty, which doth ſuddainely labour to turn him into a clean contrarie courſe.</p>
               <p>And queſtionleſſe if the very entrance into a war, the war it ſelf if it want juſtice, it will want alſo happie ſucceſſe. It cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your Majeſtie, that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> carrieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo lofty; that he would have all men perſwaded that he hath, and doth exerciſe a kind of dominion over the will of your Majeſtie, and of his Highneſſe. All things ſhall be made manifeſt to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, if you will have them ſo; for there are not meanes wanting, whereby you may free your vaſſal from fear and diffidence, who
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:111544:132"/>will otherwiſe dare nothing, nor ſay nothing, which certainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares ſo far to be true, that when all things ſtanding as they do, it is an eaſie matter to find who will ſpeak againſt your Majeſtie, yet there is none that dare ſpeak againſt the Duke.</p>
               <p>Let your Majeſtie call ſome certain men unto you, and ſiſt out of them, the opinion of the more moderate Parliament, and enquire of thoſe that come out of <hi>Spain,</hi> who did firſt give the firſt cauſe of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out? whether the Complaints againſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> be true, or no? whether that foreſaid King were not deſirous to ſatisfie the deſire of the Prince his Highneſſe? Whether he did not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavour to effect the marriage? Whether the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did not many things againſt the authoritie and reverence due to the moſt illuſtrious Prince? Whether he was not wont to be ſitting, whileſt the Prince ſtood, and was in preſence, and alſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his feet reſting upon another ſeat, after an undecent manner? Whether when the Prince was uncovered, whileſt the Queen, and Infanta, looked out at the Windowes he uncovered his head, or no? Whether ſitting at the Table with the Prince he did not behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unreverently? Whether he were not wont to come in to the Princes Chamber with his cloathes half on, ſo that the doors could not be opened to them that came to viſit the Prince from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Door-keepers refuſing to go in for modeſties ſake? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not call the Prince by ridiculous names? Whether he did not diſhonour and prophane the Kings Palace with baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible women? Whether he did not divers obſcene things, and uſed not immodeſt geſticulations and wanton Tricks with Players in the preſence of the Prince? Whether he did not violate his faith given to the <hi>Conde O livares?</hi> Whether he did not preſently commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his diſcontents, offences and complaints to the Embaſſadours of other Princes? Whether in doing of his buſineſſe, he did not uſe frequent threatenings unto the Catholique Kings Miniſters, and to Apoſtolical Nuns? Whether he did not affect to fit at Playes preſented in the Kings Palace after the manner and example of the King, and Prince, being not contented with the honour that is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily given to the High Steward, or <hi>Major domo</hi> of the Kings houſe. Beſides all theſe things which have heretofore been told your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, there is yet this more, that is new:</p>
               <p>That the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (with what intention let others judge) hath divulged in Parliament ſome ſecret Treatie negotiated betwixt your Majeſtie and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> touching the affaires of <hi>Holland;</hi> the ſecreſie whereof, nevertheleſſe your Majeſtie had ſo
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:111544:133"/>recommended, that beſides the King, and the <hi>Coude</hi> of <hi>Olivares,</hi> no man in <hi>Spain</hi> knew of it.</p>
               <p>If the Duke do not appear guilty of all theſe things, let him be ſtill your Majeſties moſt faithful ſervant, and let your Majeſtie yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon him greater Honours, if you can. For I would have theſe things conceived to be ſpoken for the ſecuritie of your Majeſtie; not for the hurt of him, to whom I wiſh proſperitie, if by him the Chriſtian world might be in proſperitie.</p>
               <p>It onely remaineth, that your Majeſtie will be pleaſed to take in good part this my ſervice and obedience ſhewed to your Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>

               <p>They ſay, the buſineſſe of greateſt conſequence, that ever your Majeſtie handled, is now at point to go well, or ill. The marriage, or none, and (as it is carried) a preſent War, or a continued Peace. The match of your ſon, they wiſh you may perfect in your own time, and think that for the quiet of your ſelf and Kingdomes, the ſhorteſt time the beſt: And that this already traced will far ſooner piece, then any new one have beginning and accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>They fear this ſuſpenſion carried by <hi>Killegrew</hi> was brought by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> not for what he pretends, and plainly ſay, It was not onely to prevent his Highneſſe marriage there, but any where.</p>
               <p>Whereby, 1. His particular greatneſſe may ſtill ſtand abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Wife, and Tribe ſtill preſent the Princeſſe perſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And your Majeſtie be, and remain their Pupil.</p>
               <p>The Parliament ſo much urged, they ſay, is to be a marrying his Mightineſſe unto the Common Weal, that as your Majeſtie is his
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:111544:133"/>good Father, It may be his Mother, and ſo he ſtand not only by the King, but by the People, and popular humour, that he hath lately ſo earneſtly courted, and eſpecially from thoſe who are noted to be of the moſt troubled humour.</p>
               <p>How your Majeſtie ſhould gain upon a Parliament they cannot imagine, ſeeing all are reſolved to ſell your Courteſies at the deareſt rate both by ill words, and for double as much again, the humour of it being ſo inconſtant, that twenty to one, but thoſe very tongues, which in the laſt did cry <hi>War, War, War,</hi> will now curſe him that ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for one poor Subſidie to raiſe a War. And miſerable is he, that is to make a War, or to defend againſt it, with money that is to be given, and gathered from them.</p>
               <p>They ſay, our Great Duke bath certainly a brave deſire to War, but in that alſo, he hath ſome great end of enriching himſelf, which he too well loveth, being carried away with that ſweet ſound, how <hi>Nottingham</hi> gained yearly during that fickneſſe 40000 <abbr>l.</abbr> by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals place; but what his Majeſtie gained, they find not in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer or Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Somewhat alſo they fear this his Graces precipitate humour, and change of humour, hath of pride, to ſhew his power as great here, as is <hi>Olivares</hi> his there, as alſo of revenge againſt him in particular. For were it love to his now much beloved Countrie, they ſay, there was as much reaſon for breach both of the Match, and Peace when the Parliament urged it, as there is now.</p>
               <p>They ſay, There is a rumour of his Graces, a match for his <hi>Mary</hi> with the young <hi>Palatine.</hi> It is no <hi>Gorgon;</hi> and will concern his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if they that are now our beſt friends the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould change their Copie.</p>
               <p>In this his Highneſſe coming off from <hi>Spain,</hi> they ſay, He hath adviſed him to no worſe then he did himſelf; for how many did he deflour, abuſe, and couſen with marriage, by his grace in Court, and power with your Majeſtie?</p>
               <p>In ſhort, your Subjects that have ſence of your eſtate, do moſt earneſtly beſeech your Majeſtie, to have more eſpecial care of your own preſervation, then ordinarily you have, both in reſpect of the deſperate ſtaggering which their Prieſts now ſtand in, and of your own <hi>Phaeton</hi> himſelf, who in truth wanteth nothing of man enough but a good nature, and being in cuſtome to carry all with a high hand, muſt be deſperate if he fail in any <hi>Punto</hi> of his violent will.</p>

               <p>THat this great oppoſition againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up and maintained by ſuch, who either malitiouſly, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly and concurrently ſeek the debaſing of this free Monarchie, which becauſe they find not yet ripe to attempt againſt the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they endeavour it through the Dukes ſide. Theſe men though agreeing in one miſchief, yet are of divers ſorts and humours, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Medling, and buſie perſons, who took their firſt hint at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of King <hi>James,</hi> when the union was treated of in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That learned King gave too much way to thoſe popular ſpeeches, by the frequent proof he had of his great abilities in that kind.</p>
               <p>Since the time of <hi>H.</hi> 6. theſe Parliamentary diſcourſings were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffered, as being the certain ſymptomes of ſubſequent rebellions, civil Wars, and the dethroning of our Kings. But theſe laſt 20 years moſt of the Parliament men ſeek to improve the reputation of their wiſdomes by theſe Declamations, and no honeſt Patriot dare oppoſe them, leſt he incur the reputation of a Fool, or a Coward in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Covetous Landlords, Incloſers, Depopulators, and Juſtices of the Peace, who have got a habit of Omniregencie, and an hope to extend the ſame againſt the King in Parliament, as they do on his Subjects in the Countrey. Hereby the King loſeth 24000 <abbr>l.</abbr> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whole Subſidie; for <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. it was 80000 <abbr>l.</abbr> and now it is but 56000 <abbr>l.</abbr> which cometh by the decay of the yeomandry, who were three and four pound men. And theſe Gentlemen (moſt of them of the Parliament) do eaſe themſelves to afflict thoſe who are the true Commons, and yet perſwade them, that the grievances are cauſed by the Duke, and the ill government of the King.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:111544:134"/>
               <p n="3">3. Recuſants and Church Papiſts, whoſe hatred is irreconcileable againſt the Duke for the breach of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match. The <hi>French</hi> Lady, though as zealous a Catholique, doth not pleaſe him, for they were tyed to <hi>Spain</hi> by their hopes of a change of Religion that way. All the Prieſts are ſent from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions, and the ſons and daughters of the Papiſts remain as hoſtages of their fidelities in the Colledges and Nunneries of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have no place in the houſe of Commons, yet privately they ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate all ſcandals againſt the Duke, to kindle a ſeparation between the King and his people, and avert them from enabling the King to reſiſt, or be avenged of our great enemy. Remember the courſe held by theſe men in the Parliament of undertakers; alſo Dr. <hi>Egleſham</hi> and all the Prieſts daily practice libelling againſt all great men about the King.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Needy and indebted perſons in both Houſes, who endeavour by theſe Parliamentary ſtirres not ſo much the Dukes overthrow, as a rebellion, which they hope will follow if it be not done. This is much to be ſuſpected, as well by their Calumniations againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, as for their own wants; many of them being outlawed, and not able to ſhew their heads, but in Parliament time by priviledge thereof, and they know, that there are enough to follow them in the ſame miſchief.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Puritans and all other Sectaries, who though ſcarce two of them agree in what they would have, yet they all in general are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Government. They begun in Parliament about <hi>Anno</hi> 23. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and ſpit their venom not only againſt the Biſhops, but alſo againſt the Lord Chancellour <hi>Hatton,</hi> and others, the Queens favourites, and Councellours, as they do now againſt the Clergie and the Duke. But their main diſcontentment is againſt the Kings Government, which they would have extinguiſhed in matters Eccleſiaſtical, and limited in Temporal. This is a fearful and important Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it pretends Conſcience and Religion, and they now more deadly hate the Duke, becauſe he ſheweth himſelf to be no Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, as they hoped he would at his return from <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Malecontents cenſured or decourted for their deſerts, as the kindred and dependants of the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and of Sir <hi>Henry Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton, Coke, Lake, Middleſex,</hi> though all of them (the laſt excepted) were dejected by King <hi>James</hi> without any Concurrencie of the Duke. Others becauſe they are not preferred, as they do imagine that they deſerve, as the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> Earl of <hi>Clare,</hi> Sir <hi>John Eliot, Selden,</hi> and <hi>Glanvile,</hi> Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Nerwich</hi> and <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:111544:135"/>Theſe, and many others, according to the nature of envy, look upon every one with an evil eye, eſpecially upon the Duke, who either hath, or doth not prefer them to thoſe places, or retain them in them, which their ambition expecteth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Lawyers in general, for that (as Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> could not but often expreſſe) our Kings have upholden the power of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, and the rights of the Clergie, whereby their comings in have been abated. And therefore the Lawyers are fit ever in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments to ſecond any Complaint againſt both Church, and King, and all his ſervants, with their Caſes, Antiquities, Records, Statutes, Preſidents, and Stories. But they cannot, or will not call to mind, that never any Nobleman in favour with his Soveraign was queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Parliament, except by the King himſelf in caſe of Treaſon, or unleſſe it were in the nonage, and tumultuous times of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. or <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. which happened to the deſtruction both of the King and Kingdom. And that not to exceed our own, and Fathers memories, in King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. time <hi>Wolſies</hi> exorbitant power and pride, and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> contempt of the Nobility and the Lawes, were not yet permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be diſcuſſed in Parliament, though they were moſt odious and grievous to all the Kingdom. And that <hi>Leiceſter's</hi> undeſerved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and faults; <hi>Hatton's</hi> inſufficiency, and <hi>Rawleigh's</hi> inſolence far exceeded, what yet hath been (though moſt falſly) objected againſt the Duke: yet no Lawyer durſt abet, nor any man elſe begin any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt them in Parliament.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Merchants and Citizens of <hi>London</hi> convinced (not by the Duke, but) by <hi>Cranfield</hi> and <hi>Ingram,</hi> to have deceived the King of Impoſts and Cuſtoms, and deſervedly fearing to be called to accompt for undoing all the other Cities and good Towns, and the poor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie of <hi>Virginia,</hi> as alſo for tranſporting of our ſilver into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> theſe vent their malice upon the Duke in the <hi>Exchange, Pauls, Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> with their ſuggeſtions, and therein they wound, both to Subjects and ſtrangers the honour of his Majeſtie, and his proceedings.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Innovators, <hi>Plebicolae,</hi> and King-haters. At the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it was a phraſe to ſpeak, yea to pray for the Queen and State. This word <hi>(State)</hi> was learned by our neighbourhood and Commerce with the Low-Countries, as if we were, or affected to be governed by States. This the Queen ſaw, and hated. And the old Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> his Propoſitions at her death, they awakened King <hi>James</hi> to prevent this humour, and to oppoſe the conditions and limitations preſented unto him by the Parliaments.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:111544:135"/>
               <p>The Lawyers, Citizens, and Weſtern men (who are moſt hot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Puritaniſme) ſtood ſtrong againſt him under a colour of Parliaments, and Parliamentary priviledges. His Majeſtie therefore ſtrengthened himſelf ever with ſome Favourite, as whom he might better truſt then many of the Nobility tainted with this deſire of Oligarchie. It behoveth without doubt his Majeſtie to uphold the Duke againſt them, who if he be but decourted, it will be the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone on which the demoliſhing of his Monarchie will be builded. For, if they prevail with this, they have hatched a thouſand other demands to pull the feathers of the Royalty, they will appoint him Councellours, Servants, Alliances, Limits of his expences, Accompts of his Revenue, chiefly if they can (as they mainly deſire) they will now dazle him in the beginning of his reign.</p>
               <p n="10">10. King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> laſtly, are the Dukes Accuſers; (my meaning is, with all humble reverence to their Honours, and Memories, and to ſpeak in the ſence of the Houſe of Commons) both their Majeſties are <hi>Conjuncta Perſona</hi> in all the aſperſions that are laid upon the Duke. For inſtance, The Parliaments money deſtined for the Wars, ſpent in the Treaties, Meſſages, Embaſſadours, and Entertainments of the Kings marriage, and the burial of his Father, and the War in the name of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> the Breach of both the Treaties, which then Canonized the Duke, but now is made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him; the Honours and Offices conferred upon him by King <hi>James,</hi> That his Majeſtie might with his own Councels direct their managing, the ſetting forth of the Navy, though to the Duke's great charge by both their Commandments; the Match with <hi>France,</hi> and generally whatſoever hath not been ſucceſſeful to mens expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All theſe, though the Acts of the Kings are imputed to the Duke, who if he ſuffer for obeying his Soveraigns, the next attempt will be to call the King to accompt for any thing he undertakes, which doth not proſperouſly ſucceed as all men would deſire it.</p>
               <p>If it pleaſe his Majeſtie to remove, and ſet aſide all theſe diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, He ſhall find the Charge laid againſt the Duke will prove very empty, and of ſmall moment. And for them, if his Majeſtie and the Duke's Grace think it no impeachment to their Honors, all that the Parliament hath objected againſt the Duke, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned at the Kings Coronation, which benefit every poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject enjoyeth. Three things onely excepted which may moſt eaſily be anſwered.</p>

               <p>IT is intimated to your Lordſhip, firſt, that you would procure his Majeſtie to deſire the Lords to chooſe ſix (or ſo many as you ſhall think fit) of whom they have moſt confidence to attend him to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning, to whom his Majeſtie may be pleaſed to declare; That he hath endeavoured to divert the charges againſt your Lordſhip, becauſe his Majeſtie hath had ſound knowledge, and experience of the ſervice, and fidelity (though in outward ſhew the contrarie might juſtly appear) and becauſe alſo he ſaw, it was urged with a great deal of private ſpleen, and perhaps not without ſome Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call device of troubling his Majeſties buſineſſe in Parliament, but ſeeing no ſuite, or perſwaſion could prevail to appeaſe the diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red courſe, his Majeſtie is now forced, and ſo pleaſed to reveal ſome ſecrets, and <hi>Arcana</hi> of State, which otherwiſe in the wiſedom of Kings were unfit to be opened. Here his Majeſtie may let them know, that the King his Father finding the <hi>Palatinate</hi> more then in danger to be loſt, and after his Majeſtie being in <hi>Spain,</hi> and there deluded, and his abode, and return, both unſafe. It was a neceſſity of State to ſweeten, and content the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with a hope of any thing that might ſatisife, and redeem thoſe ingagements, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willed your Lordſhip to yield diſcreetlie to what you ſhould find they moſt deſired, and this was chiefly the point of religion; ſo as in this and all of the like kind, your Lordſhip (upon his Majeſties knowledge) was commanded, and but the inſtrument truſted by your Maſter in this exigent, or (if you will) extremitie. And this with other more Potent overtures (ſuch as your Lordſhip beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands) may Cancel all thoſe objections of that nature. Upon this ſame ground, though not in ſo high a degree, the ſending of the ſhips to <hi>Rochel</hi> may be excuſed (and this is not the leaſt fault ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the opinion of the wiſeſt.) Touching the vaſt creation of Nobility his Majeſtie may ask thoſe ſix Lords (whereof perchance ſome of them may be concerned in this article,) whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any reaſon of King <hi>James</hi> his doing herein; to which I ſuppoſe, they will ſtand mute. Then his Majeſtie may ſay, I will tell you, and therein diſcover a truth, and a ſecret of State. My Father who was born a King, and had long experience of that Regiment, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie more traverſed in this point, then perhaps ever any King, found that this State inclined much to Popularitie, a thing apparent univerſallie in all the Courts, viz. in that of Star-chamber, which was
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:111544:136"/>at firſt erected to reſtrain the inſolence of Great men, in great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, but now for every pettie offence, the meaneſt Tennant may be bold to call thither his Lord. A thing alſo appearing in the ſawcie approaches of the Puritans upon the Biſhops  and plainely in the boldneſſe of the houſe of Commons againſt the Kings pattents, and edicts, which in all good times (out of their neceſſity) have been powerful. And eſpeciallie this humour hath been comforted by the ſturdie example of the Neighbour States of the Low-countries, as in their inſolencies in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> &amp;c. From this place an inticing voice hath ſounded in our eares of libertie and freedom, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a feigned voyce, and (but in ſound) unſound. I ſay when the king my Father had well beheld theſe things, he could not foreſee a remedie more proper, or eaſier, as being unſerviceable and in his own gripe, then to inlarge the number of his Nobles, that theſe being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed into ſeveral Counties might as lambs of Soveraigntie, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their own degrees, and at their own charge inure the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with reſpect, and obedience to greatneſſe; and yet not to amate, and diſcourage them, he thought good to raiſe ſome neer, or of their own rank, whereby they might ſee themſelves in poſſibility of the like honour, if either by virtue, wealth, or honeſtie they make themſelves worthie. This I proteſt was a child of my Fathers beſt judgment in this poynt, and the Duke but the inſtrument thereof. And if you ſay, that there was mony many times given for theſe Honours, nay if you ſay, that mony hath been given for places of Clergie, and Judicature; I pray take this of me, that this is ſo in all other Countries, as in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> And thoſe Councels ſeem a little to ſmile at our dulneſſe, that we have ſo lately apprehended their ſoundneſſe herein; for (ſay they) when men pay well for ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is the beſt kind of ſecurity for their honeſties, eſpecially when ſayling in their dutie, they ſhall be ſure to be as much puniſhed as they were advanced. Howbeit I am not ſatisfied in this opinion. And if it be ſaid that the King ſhould have had the mony, which the Duke took to his own uſe; I believe this laſt is more, then any can prove, neither will I deliver what I know therein. Howſoever, it matters not much being no popular diſburſment. Only this I will ſay, that I know the Dukes particular ſervice, and affection to me, and that he, and his will lay down themſelves, and all they have at my Feet. Neither is this bare opinion, ſince the Duke alone hath diburſed, and ſtands engaged more for my affaires, and the States, then any Number of Noblemen of <hi>England</hi> whatſoever, and therefore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:111544:137"/>there is reaſon, that from a King he would receive his own and more.</p>
               <p>And now (my Lords) ſince I have thus far opened a Kings Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet unto you at leaſt by the meaſure of this foot of anſwer, you may diſcover, what may be ſaid concerning that great bodie, and bulk of accuſations of the Higheſt kind made againſt the Duke. I deſire you would take it to heart, remembring, that it is your King, that ſpeaketh this, who therefore expects your ſervice, and love here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and who will requite the ſame aſſuredly; hoping you will believe me indeed, and do accordingly indeed, and that you will alſo reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that my ſpirit is not ſo young (though a young King) as that I would bring this teſtimony in mine own wrong, were not that I ſay, true in my own knowledge. And being ſo, you alſo will grant, that it is not for a King to uſe his Servant, and Inſtrument as he doth his Horſes, which being by hard riding in his ſervice foundred, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to turn them off to graſſe, or to the Cart. I muſt therefore in right of the King my Fathers Honour and my own, protect a man (though I have ſaid juſtly ſeeming guiltie, yet) in mine own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge innocent, and free as I have delivered it; will you then deny the King to favour whom he pleaſe, which the King hath never denyed you, that are his ſubjects? will you controle me your Head and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in things wherein your ſelves have taken liberty uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? would you that I ſhould require accompt of your liberalitie? nay of all your failings, which are liable to my authority? well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to my Lords, and tell them, that if any thing had been formerly done amiſſe by others, I have power, and will to redreſſe it, and to prevent the like. I ſpeak it in the word of a King, neither Lords, nor Commons can deſire of me any thing that is honeſt, which I am not ready to give them. Let not therefore the world by theſe miſtakings make Table-talk any longer of your King and his negotiations? nay of his ſecrets and neceſſities; for alas what great wrong, or indignity can the Glorie of the State receive, then that the private grudges of ſubjects (accuſing to the ignorant, when in their conſciences they could excuſe) ſhould be the buſineſſe of our Parliament, and that the King himſelf ſhould be forced to appear as a partie? No doubt this is a Cocatrice egge, that craftie heads of our enemies ſeek to hatch, whileſt the weightie affaires that in preſent concern the Honour, and welfare of the King and State, and the peace of all Chriſtendome are by us utterly neglected.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:111544:137"/>
               <p>I end, hoping your Lordſhip (now privy to theſe things) will be tender of your Soveraigns honour, and will ſo ſatisfie, and treat with the reſt, that thoſe particular janglings may be by ſome other courſe, and in ſome other place and time diſcuſſed and determined, that ſo our minds and time may be employed in the care of better things, which earneſtly invoke our ayd at this inſtant.</p>
               <p>Thus much ſpoken, or written, or the like, (for I ſeek but to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken your Lordſhips higher ſpirit and invention) I conceive it may get this effect: That theſe 6. Lords won by theſe reaſons, and by other the Kings invitations, may deliver to the Houſe, that for their parts, they have received unexpected ſatisfaction in thoſe greateſt points of the accuſation againſt your Lordſhip, and of ſuch ſecret nature as are not fit to be publiſhed without further deliberation. Wherefore ſince it pleaſed their Lordſhips, to have made choyce of them to be truſted in this imployment, they have faithfully ſerved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and do upon their Honours freely, and without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement or reſpect, proteſt the fame. And therefore humbly deſire their Lordſhips, that they would intreat his Majeſtie to be Preſident in advice with their Lordſhips: What further were to be done in this private Contention betwixt your Lordſhip and the Lord <hi>Digbie;</hi> which obtained, ſomething may then follow for your Lordſhips good, by yeelding up that Cauſe into the Kings hands. And his Majeſtie hath great reaſon to bend it that way, becauſe it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Lords will be loath to admit the King to be ſupream Judge, and Accuſer; which point will much touch his Majeſtie. And his Majeſtie were better give ſome eaſe to the Lord <hi>Digbie,</hi> then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that diſpute.</p>
               <p>And now for my ſelf, I beſeech your Lordſhip to pardon my ſtrange boldneſſe; I know I am a mere ſtranger to you, and if ever you have heard of me, it muſt be as of a friend of ſuch you then did not love. I know it ſhewes me a medler in buſineſſe, or an inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which are ſuſpitions, that may diſtaſt you, and make you ſuſpect my pretences, though they were not altogether witleſſe. I know this diſadvantage, and am in my own nature offended for putting my ſelf thus into your notions. But yet I reſolved to undergo all this; Firſt, becauſe you made my Brother a Captain in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had otherwiſe periſhed. Next, for the favour you did to my Lord of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the retiring of disfavour from my Lord of <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet.</hi> And laſtly, for your firm hand, that advanced the now Lord Treaſurer. To all which Lords I am familiarly known, and bound.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:111544:138"/>But (neereſt to you) your Lordſhip may hear of me from the Lord Treaſurer.</p>
               <p>I am confident of your Lordſhips noble interpretation, ſince I ſeek no ends, no acquaintance, no other thanks, being one that have no Court-ſuits to your Lordſhip; but being one that loves not ruines, (which my friends have taſted) nor that the publique ſhould wreſtle with a private Inturn of Spleen. And I offer it but as a ſimplicity, yet with good will enough; for what can a man, that is not privy to the Elements of State, demonſtrate any concluſion thereof; yet I hear ſometimes how the world goes as other men do.</p>
               <p>I conceive I have ſaid ſomething to your Lordſhip, and though perhaps ſhort, yet enough to occaſion, and ſtir up your deeper thoughts. I alſo may have deeper, but alſo I know, that little pinnes of wood do ſuſtain the whole building. More I could have ſaid touching the other points, but theſe greateſt elided, the fall of the others may be eaſily directed. What I have ſaid againſt thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections I touched, doth ariſe from grounds of truth, and they muſt win, and prevail, and my conceit is fitted to the Kings part, and to the occaſions now on foot.</p>
               <p>I humbly ceaſe your Lordſhip further trouble, and wiſh you all good, deſiring your Lordſhip alſo to pardon my tedious and haſty ſcribled hand.</p>

               <p>I Thought my hands bound that I could no ſooner have occaſion to write unto you, being forced againſt my will to delay my writing from day to day in expectation of the news of your arrival at that Court, aſſuring my ſelf, that I ſhould then receive from you ſome ground whereupon to write. But after a long expence of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I could hear of your arrival, and in the Pacquet that his Majeſties Embaſſadour ſent thereafter, receiving no Letters nor word from you as I expected, I do now by theſe break my long filence unto you.</p>
               <p>As for news from hence, I can in a word aſſure you, that they are in all points, as your heart could wiſh: for here is a King, a a Prince, and a faithful friend and ſervant unto you, beſides a number of your other good friends, that long ſo much for the happy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this match, as every day ſeems a year unto us, and I can aſſure you in the word of your honeſt friend, that we have a Prince here, that is ſo ſharp ſet upon the buſineſſe, as it would much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you to ſee it, and her there to hear it. Here are all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared upon our parts; Prieſts and Recuſants all at liberty: all the Roman Catholiques well ſatisfied, and which will ſeem a wonder unto you, our Priſons are emptied of Prieſts and Recuſants, and filled with zealous Miniſters for preaching againſt the Match; for no man can ſooner now mutter a word in the Pulpit though indirectly againſt it, but he is preſently catched, and ſet in ſtraight priſon. We have alſo publiſhed Orders both for the Univerſities, and the Pulpits, that no man hereafter ſhall meddle, but to preach Chriſt crucified; Nay it ſhall not be lawful hereafter for them to rail againſt the Pope, or the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> further then for edification of ours; and for proof hereof you ſhall herewith receive the orders ſet down, and publiſhed. But if we could hear as good news from you, we ſhould think our ſelves happy men; but alas! Now that we have put the ball at your feet, although we have received a comfortable Diſpatch from his Majeſties Embaſſadour there; yet from all other parts in the world, the effects appear directly contrary. For Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> brings us news from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the diſpenſation there is at a ſtand, except a number of new Conditions be granted, which we never dreamed of, and ſome of them can tend to no other end, but to bring our Maſter in jealouſie with the greateſt part of his Subjects; nay
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:111544:139"/>which is ſtrangeſt of all, we find ſome points yeelded unto by us, (which would have given the Pope good ſatisfaction) to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from him by the King your Maſters miniſters there. We were never more troubled to put a good face upon an ill Game, then we were upon <hi>Gage's</hi> arrival here, which in your phraſe is to put a good ſauce to an unſavoury diſh.</p>
               <p>For the whole world being in expectation of bringing the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with him, we are now forced to make him give it out here to all his friends, that 'tis paſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent from thence to <hi>Spain.</hi> And from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> we find, that notwithſtanding, both of the King your Maſters promiſes, and undertaking of the Infanta there, who hath long ago acknowledged to have had power from the Emperour for granting of this long-talked of Ceſſation, yet now after innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delayes on her part, <hi>Heidelbergh</hi> is beſieged by Count <hi>Tilley,</hi> and that at ſuch a time, as his Majeſtie cannot imagine what ground or ſhadow of excuſe can be found for his Commiſſion. For the Treaty hath been twice reformed at her deſire, and all the Auxiliaries ſuch as <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> have taken another courſe: His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſon in law ſtaying privately in <hi>Sedan,</hi> ready to obey all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties directions; and the places in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which are not already in his enemies hands, being onely poſſeſſed by his Majeſties Souldiers. So as now if the War ſhall continue, it muſt be directly between the Emperour, and our Maſter, his Majeſtie having ſent a Commandment to his Embaſſadour at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> that if <hi>Tilley</hi> will needs go on with that ſiege, that he return hither with all ſpeed. For his Majeſtie in honour cannot endure, that whileſt he is treating for a ceſſation of Arms at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> the Wars ſhould go on in the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> eſpecially when they have no body to invade, but his Majeſties own Subjects and ſervants; And indeed his Majeſtie thinks he is very ill dealt withal, for all that great ſincerity and candour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath conſtantly carried himſelf from the very beginning of this buſineſſe, that no leſſe can ſatisfie the Emperours revenge then the utter extermination of his children both of honour and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and not without a direct breach of his former promiſe, avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſet down in his laſt Letter to his Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>And now let me I pray you in the name of your faithful friend, and Servant, beſeech you to ſet apart all partialitie in this caſe, and that you would be pleaſed indifferently to conſider of the ſtreights we are driven into, if the Emperour ſhall in this faſhion conquer the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the antient inheritance of his Majeſties children: what can be expected but a bloudie and unreconcileable war between the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:111544:139"/>Emperour, and my Maſter wherein the King of <hi>Spain</hi> can be an Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliarie to the Emperour againſt any other partie but his Majeſtie. And therefore as my Maſter lately offered to the Infanta for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of her deſire, that in caſe the Auxiliaries would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with reaſon, but ſtill perturbe the treatie, he offered in that caſe to aſſiſt the Emperour and her againſt them; ſo can he in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice expect no leſſe of the King your Maſter, that if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour will contrarie to all promiſes both by his Letters, and Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, proceed in his conqueſt, and refuſe the ceſſation, that the King your Maſter will in that caſe, and in ſo juſt a quarrel aſſiſt him againſt the Emperour, in imitation of the King my Maſters juſt and reall proceedings in the buſineſſe from the beginning, who never looked (as you can well be witneſſe) to the riſing, or faling hopes of his ſon in Law his fortunes, but conſtantly keep on that courſe, that was moſt agreable to honour and juſtice, to the peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom; and for the faſtning of a firm &amp; indiſſoluble knot of amity, and alliance betwixt the king your Maſter and him, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the time of the treatie with <hi>France,</hi> and then broken at your deſire, that we might imbrace this alliance with you; you are the perſon, that many times before your departure hence, beſought his Majeſtie once to ſuffer himſelf to be deceived by <hi>Spain.</hi> We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do now expect to find that great reſpect to honour in the King your Maſter, that he will not take any advantage by the changing of fortune, and ſucceſſe of time, ſo to alter his actions, as may put his Honour in the terms of interpretation. You ſee how all the reſt of Chriſtendom, envie and maligne this match and wiſhed conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; How much greater need then hath it of a haſtie and happie diſpatch? And what comfort can the Prince have in her, when her friends ſhall have utterly ruined his Siſter, and all her babes? you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how your ſelf prayſed his Majeſties wiſdom in the election of ſo fit a Miniſter, as Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> in this buſineſſe, but you ſaw what deſperate Letters he writes from time to time of their cold and unjuſt treating with him in this buſineſſe; you could not but wonder at any ſpark of Patience could be left us here; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point in a word, we ever received comfortable words from <hi>Spain,</hi> but find ſuch contrary effects from <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> together with our intelligences from all other parts of the world, as all our hopes are not only cold, but quite extinguiſhed here. Thus far for the By, and yet ſuch a By, as may put by the main, if it be not well and ſpeedily prevented. As to the Main, which is the match, his Majeſtie, and we all here, thought we had done our part, and put the ball at your
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:111544:140"/>foot, when wee agreed upon the twentie, and five Atticles more: whereupon as your ſelf often anſwered, and aſſured us the beſt Divines in <hi>Spain</hi> concluded that the Pope, not only might, but ought to grant a diſpenſation to this marriage, but now we are ſurcharged with a number of new Articles from <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the mean time the Diſpenſation is as far off as ever it was.</p>
               <p>His Majeſtie hopes that you are not ignorant, that the treatie is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and your Maſter; He hath no treatie with <hi>Rome,</hi> neither lyes it in his way to diſpute with them upon this queſtion; yet that his readineſſe to imbrace your Maſters friendſhip may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, he is contented to yield to ſo many of their demands, as either his Conſcience, Honour, or ſafetie can permit, if ſo the King your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall think it neceſſarie. But on the other part we three remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when as you firſt moved this match unto him, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to break off with <hi>France,</hi> you then promiſed, that he ſhould be preſſed to nothing in this buſineſſe, that ſhould not be agreeable to his conſcience, and honour, and ſtand with the love of his people. As to the particular Articles new added at <hi>Rome,</hi> I will not clogg this paper with them, which I fear without them, will be too troubleſome unto you. For what his Majeſties opinion is of them, his Majeſties Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour there will particularly acquaint you.</p>
               <p>But whereas the Pope deſires in the end of his Articles, that he may ſee what <hi>ponum publicum,</hi> the King our Maſter will grant unto, that may perſwade to grant this diſpenſation, I will remit it to your conſcience and knowledge, whether if the favours his Majeſtie daily grants to thoſe of his religion, and is reſolved ſtill to continue, if not to increaſe them, if they ſhall by their good behaviour deſerve it, be not a real <hi>bonum publicum,</hi> conſidering that if the match ſhould break off (which God forbid) his Majeſtie would be importunatly urged by his people (to whoſe aſſiſtance he muſt have his recourſe) to give life and execution to all the penal Lawes now hanging upon their heads.</p>
               <p>It only reſts now, that as we have put the ball to your foot, you take a good, and ſpeedie reſolution there to haſten a happy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this match. The Prince is now two and twenty years of age, and ſo a year more, then full ripe, for ſuch a buſineſſe: the King our Maſter longeth to ſee an iſſue proceed from his Loins; and I am ſure you have reaſon to expect more friendſhip from the poſterity that ſhall proceed from him, and that little Angel, your Infanta then from his Majeſties Daughters Children. Your friends here, are all diſcomforted with this long delay: your enemies are exaſperated,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:111544:140"/>and irritated thereby; and your neighbours, that envie the felicity of both Kings, have the more leiſure to invent new Plots for the Croſſe, and hinderance of this happy buſineſſe; And for the part of your true friend and ſervant <hi>Buckingham,</hi> I am become odious already, and counted a betrayer both of King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>To conclude all with; I will uſe a ſimilitude of hawking (which you will eaſily underſtand, being a great Faulkoner;) I told you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready that the Prince is (God be thanked) extreamly ſharp ſet upon this Match; and you know that a Hawke, when ſhe is firſt dreſſed, and made ready to flie, having a great will upon her, if the Faulko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do not follow it at that time, ſhe is in danger to be dulled for ever after.</p>
               <p>Take heed therefore, leſt in the fault of your delayes there, Our Prince, and Faulcon gentle, (that you know was thought ſlow enough, to begin to be eager after the Foeminine prey) become not ſo dull upon theſe delayes, as in ſhort time hereafter, he will not ſtoop to the Lure, though it were thrown out to him.</p>
               <p>And here I will end to you my ſweet friend, as I do in my prayers to God, <hi>(Onely in thee is my truſt,)</hi> and ſay as it is written on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Pacquets, Haſte, Haſte, Poſt-haſte.</p>

               <p>I Have received two Letters from your Lordſhip, the one of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>March</hi> brought me by Mr. <hi>George Gage,</hi> and the other of the 30. of <hi>April</hi> which came by the Ordinarie. In both which Letters I have received a ſpecial favour from you, and much comfort. The coming of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gage</hi> hath given me infinite contentment, then which there could nothing have happened more fitly and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the matter which is in negotiation, nor any man have come hither that could better advance the buſineſſe then he, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his good affection, as for his wiſdom and dexterity in all things. And if the King of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> will withal help now a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the buſineſſe will be quickly done, and in a good manner. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Lordſhip preach to him a Chriſtian Sermon as is moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: for there comes from thence divers wayes ſuch reports thither, that I am aſhamed, and out of countenance in the ſtreets as I go, and they do me a favour, that they do not ſtone me, knowing that I am treating, and labouring this buſineſſe at the ſame time, when the poor Catholiques are ſo cruelly uſed in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And when I excuſe it, that it is not by the Kings order, but by the abuſe and malice of ſome ill affected Miniſters, it will not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; neither do they want Replies. Beſides, there is a rumour all over <hi>Rome,</hi> that the King in a Speech which he made at the beginning of the Parliament, affirmed publiquely, <hi>That for all this marriage with</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:111544:141"/>Spain, <hi>the Catholique party in</hi> England <hi>ſhould not be in one jott better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then they are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I cannot be yet diſcouraged; My confidence is in the King, and in the deſire which I know he hath to procure a good Wife for his Son. And now that the time is come, let him play the part of a Couragious Wooer, and fruſtrate the intentions and deſires of all thoſe, that are adverſe to it. It is a comfort unto me, that I do not find here an impoſſibility; but that though there be difficulties, yet I find many here that deſire to overcome them. And above all, I hope that God will aſſiſt this buſineſſe as his own Cauſe. I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prepare my ſelf for the Congregation of the Cardinals, and a Conſultation of Divines, to whom I underſtand we ſhall be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this next week.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have underſtood by Mr. <hi>Strada</hi> with particular contentment the newes of your good health, which God continue for many years. I ſee by yours received by <hi>Strada,</hi> what his Majeſtie hath been pleaſed to order concerning the ſhips of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which is as much in effect as could be hoped for from ſo great a King, ſo zealous of Juſtice and Equitie.</p>
               <p>In the Conduct of this buſineſſe, we will obſerve the order given by his Majeſtie, in confidence that the Subjects of the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall obtain their ends, and his Catholique Majeſtie receive the contentment to know, that the exceſſes of thoſe that ſhall be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced have been puniſhed.</p>
               <p>By the laſt Currier of <hi>Flanders,</hi> we received neither from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta, nor any other perſon any other newes, then what Mr. <hi>Trumbal</hi> ſent by his Letters.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe freely, that the Marqueſſe, and my ſelf have been much troubled, both of us being exceedingly deſirous, that his Majeſtie
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:111544:142"/>ſhould receive in every thing (even in words, and formalities) the ſame ſatisfaction, which we hope he ſhall receive in the effects. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in diſcharge of her Highneſſe, I will ſay that which is fit for me as I am her ſervant, and which I pray you from me to deliver un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majeſtie; but thus underſtood, that it is onely my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>By the diſpleaſure his Majeſtie hath been pleaſed to teſtifie unto me upon many occaſions of the Prince <hi>Palatines</hi> refuſal to ſign, and ratifie the Treatie of ſuſpenſion of Armes; He may be alſo pleaſed to judge how it may have been taken by the King my Maſter in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Infanta in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the rather becauſe of the continual reports, that at the ſame time went up and down and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed (as ordinarily it falls out) of the deſcent of <hi>Alberſtat</hi> with a mighty Army of 20000 foot, and 6000 horſe, not any more to make war in <hi>Germany,</hi> but to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and fall upon thoſe Provinces in obedience to his Catholique Majeſtie, which was no other but directly to aym at the vital parts of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</p>
               <p>If for theſe juſt fears (which cannot certainly be held vain, being conſidered with thoſe of the year paſt, proceeding from one and the ſame Cauſe, both of which have been ſcattered by the Almighty hand of God, in his ſecret Judgments) it hath not onely been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but alſo neceſſary to conſerve the ancient alliances, and procure new, I leave it to the judgment of every man of underſtanding, not doubting but for this reſpect you will be of the ſame opinion with me: And much more his Majeſtie, whom God hath endowed with ſo great knowledge, and royal qualities, as are known to all the world.</p>
               <p>Morover, let us ſee if in the Law of gratitude, the <hi>Infanta</hi> could do leſſe then acknowledge towards the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the valour wherewith his Army had reſiſted the pernitious deſigns of <hi>Alberſtat,</hi> having hazarded his own eſtate to hinder the imminent danger of the King my Maſters.</p>
               <p>Again let us conſider if the Infanta ſending to viſit, and give him thanks could excuſe her ſelf from giving him all thoſe titles, which the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> gives himſelf, and deſires ſhould be given him. And if he might not, if ſhe had done otherwiſe have thought the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude the greater, then the acknowledgement. And therefore things being in this ſtate, the Infanta could not excuſe her ſelf from ſending to viſite him, ſeeing he had ſuccoured her in a time of need, and in viſiting him to give him that, which he deſired ſhould be
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:111544:142"/>given him. And the like is to be ſaid for the King my Maſter in caſe he hath done the like as Mr. <hi>Trumbal</hi> writes the Infanta ſhould tell him, and with a great deal more reaſon becauſe the Countries are his own. And therefore ſince his Majeſtie of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> is ſo great a King, and hath ſo great a reputation of the exact perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his royal obligations, I doubt not but he will judge, that in this formality, the King my Maſter, and the Infanta his Aunt, have but acquitted themſelves of their obligations. For the reſt, if at the conferrence of <hi>Cullen,</hi> which his ſaid Majeſtie, and her Highneſſe have deſired, and do yet deſire his Majeſtie of great <hi>Brittain</hi> ſhall ſee, that they are wanting on their part to proceed with that ſincerity and truth, which they have ſo often offered, and which the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ynoioſa</hi> doth ſtill offer on the behalf of the King my Maſter, ſo that only the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> make the ſubmiſſions due to the Emperour as his natural Lord, and reſolvie to follow the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal counſels of his Majeſtie of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> his Majeſtie ſhall then have reaſon to complain. And in the mean time the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> ſhould do but well not to entertain thoſe Amities he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to conſerve, nor to ſollicit thoſe Leagues which he labours to procure, not only with the declared rebells of the King my Maſter, and of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but alſo with the enemies of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. I will ingage my head if following this way his Majeſtie and his ſon in law find themſelves deceived.</p>
               <p>You know Sir, that I treat in truth, and freedom, and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hope you will impute my excuſes to that, and will not call this libertie of my diſcourſe, raſhneſſe, but an immortal deſire in me in all things to procure the ſervice of our Kings, laying aſide all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of miſunderſtandings, now we treat of nothing els, but uniting our ſelves more by the ſtrickt bonds of love, over and above thoſe of our Alliance.</p>
               <p>I do humbly beſeech you to ſay thus much to his Majeſtie, and to aſſure him from me, that when he ſhall be pleaſed to imploy me in this matter, as in all other, he ſhall ever find me faithful and real, as I have offered my ſelf, and alwayes continue, being well aſſured, that even in that I ſhall ſerve my Maſter.

                  <hi>The Marqueſſe</hi> Yuoioſa <hi>to the Lord</hi> Conway, 5. September, 1623.</head>
               <p>I Anſwered not long ſince to both your Letters, and now I will add this, that only the ſport, and pleaſure that <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Majeſtie hath in his progreſſe, may make tollerable the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring (by reaſon of that) and not hearing the newes we expect to hear of his Majeſties good health. For by that meanes we might not onely ſatisfie more often our deſires in this point (having his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie neerer) but alſo our deſire to bring theſe buſineſſes to an end, which are ordinarily more delayed, and leſſe well executed, when they are to paſſe through the hands of Miniſters (though they be very zealous, and well affected to it) as theſe Lords are with whom we treat here; who are deſirous that the King ſhould be known for juſt, though unneceſſarily, when nothing is pretended contrarie to that which is agreed upon. This knowledge whereupon I ground my reaſons may perhaps make me <hi>(Sin Embargo)</hi> incurre the Cenſure of an impatient man; But I am perſwaded, that if that which hath been done here, had been ſetled there by your Honour, and the Lord <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Carleil</hi> (whoſe good diſpoſition, and proceeding is as much to be eſteemed as it is prayſed by <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and my ſelf) we would have made an end, and thoſe things, which I have ſeen, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved here had not happened unto us. For in the conference, in which my Lord Keeper did aſſiſt, it was agreed (as we thought) that his Majeſtie ſhould give order to the Judges and Juſtices of Peace, Arch-biſhops and Biſhops ſigned with his royal hand under the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Seale within three months, or at the Princeſſe her arival. He hath perſiſted afterwards, as alſo Sir <hi>George Calvert</hi> in that (though it was plain) that his Majeſtie would give the ſaid warrant, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, there being no tearm nor day appointed. Nevertheleſſe at laſt we have condeſcended, that it ſhould be within ſix months, or at her Highneſſe arrival, if ſhe comes afore that time, that we may ſhew how happie we think our ſelves in being Servants to his Majeſtie, whom God ſave.</p>
               <p>The diſpatches that we are to have are contained in the relation here encloſed. I pray you to take order, that thoſe that are to be ſent back to that effect, may be ſubſcribed, and Sealed; for I have differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the diſpatching of a Currier (with an evident danger that he will now arrive too late, and put in hazard a buſineſſe of mine of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:111544:143"/>which obligeth me to diſpatch him) that he may not go without them; And that it may not be an occaſion to doubt of the aſſurance we have given of his Majeſties good will and intention; whoſe Royal hands, I, and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> do intreat your Honour to kiſſe in our name, and to continue us in his Majeſties good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and your Honour likewiſe in yours; for we deſerve it with a particular affection, and equal deſire to ſerve you.

               <head type="sub">Theſe Paſſages were ſent to the Duke, incloſed in the last fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Letter.</head>
               <p>ON Sunday the 18. of this preſent <hi>January,</hi> the two Embaſſadors of <hi>Spain</hi> came to viſit me at my Houſe in <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi> At their firſt entrance they took occaſion to ſpeak of the profeſſion of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, affirming them to be the braveſt Friends, and the braveſt Enemies. I approved it in the Souldier, and contradicted it not in the Nation.</p>
               <p>When they were come into an Inner Room, looking upon the Company as if they deſired to be private; I cauſed them to withdraw, but noting that they had brought an Interpreter with them, I prayed Sir <hi>James Blount,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Tomkins</hi> Clark of the Princes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, (who doth well underſtand the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> tongue) to abide with me.</p>
               <p>Being private, they ſaid they came to viſit me, becauſe of the good intention, and well-wiſhing they underſtood I had to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of buſineſſes, and becauſe I ſtood named by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie for the imployment into <hi>Germanie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I acknowledged their coming to viſit me as a particular Favour, profeſſing my ſelf to be one of thoſe, who was able to do leaſt, but that I muſt and would in all things conform my ſelf to the will, and good pleaſure of the King my Maſter.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:111544:144"/>
               <p>They were pleaſed to remember, and to take for argument of his Majeſties good opinion of me, to make me one of the <hi>Junta</hi> (as they called it) of the ſelected Councellours, and his imployment given me the laſt year as his Extraordinary Embaſſadour into <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told them I had been bred a Souldier, as their Excellencies had been, but that I wanted the capacity and abilities which they had, and that for want of Language (not affecting to ſpeak by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter) I had forborn to wait on their Excellencies, as otherwiſe I would have done.</p>
               <p>To that they returned the like Complement, and then ſaid, Their Maſter had ſent a good anſwer touching the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me, that he would perform what he had promiſed with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>I ſaid if it were ſo, I then hoped all things would ſort to a good end.</p>
               <p>They then asked me how his Majeſtie, and the Lords were affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whether therewith they were ſatisfied, or no?</p>
               <p>I anſwered, That I conceived their Excellencies knew his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties mind as well as the Lords, for that they had ſo lately audience of him.</p>
               <p>They ſaid. It was true, they had ſo, but not a private audience; nor could they obtain any, though they had much deſired the ſame, but that others were ſtill preſent.</p>
               <p>I ſaid merely that they were two, and I believed that the King their Maſter had ſent as able and experienced Miniſters as he had any, and therefore his Majeſtie might peradventure think fit not to hear them alone.</p>
               <p>They ſaid his Majeſtie might alone hear a thouſand Miniſters of any Kings, but if he ſhould be otherwiſe pleaſed, they well liked of the Princes being preſent; but they ſaid there were alſo other great Miniſters of the Kings, who wiſhed not well to their Maſters affairs.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, There might therein be a miſtaking, or miſunderſtanding on their part; for if the King their Maſter mean ſo really as they ſaid, I conceived that no body would be willing to remove his Majeſtie from
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:111544:145"/>thoſe purpoſes, and that good affection which he bore unto his dear Brother the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe ſaid in Engliſh, The King was a good King, and the Prince a good Prince, but ſome of their Miniſters they doubted were ill willers to them.</p>
               <p>I asked if greater demonſtrations of reality could be deviſed, then had been given on the part of the King and Prince, inſtancing in the Prince his going in Perſon into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They confeſſed it, but as the times now were, they ſaid ill offices were done them.</p>
               <p>I aſſured them, That I neither knew, nor underſtood of any; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ever hear them ſpoken of, but with due reſpect had unto them, as to the Miniſters of a great King, and his Majeſties dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>They ſaid their meaning was not, that the ill offices were done to their Perſons, but to the great Buſineſſes, which a certain Perſon had ſhewed a willingneſſe to diſturb; but they hoped, that the intended amity between our Maſters would hold, and proceed nevertheleſſe.</p>
               <p>I profeſſed, that I knew nothing to the contrary, neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood I the particular at which they aymed.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe ſwore as he was a Chriſtian, he knew that the King his Maſter did ſo truly, and really eſteem his dear Brother the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> that if they needed part of his blood, they ſhould have it for their good: But he complained, that they could not have their Meſſages delivered nor returned from the King of late, but qualified according to the pleaſures of others.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, They miſconceived it, for I thought they had no cauſe to complain, ſeeing they now had, or might have (as I ſuppoſed) the Kings Ear when they craved it in due, and befitting times.</p>
               <p>They ſeemed to deny it, alledging, That they could not get their Meſſages and Papers anſwered as aforetime.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, When the Prince was in <hi>Spain,</hi> they had free acceſſe to his Majeſtie, whenſoever they deſired it.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:111544:145"/>
               <p>Yea ſaid the Marqueſſe in Latine <hi>Tune;</hi> but now, he ſaid, the eaſe was altered.</p>
               <p>I ſaid the King had given many teſtimonies to the world of his willingneſſe to comply with their Maſter, and Them: And if either his Majeſtie or the Prince ſeemed now more reſerved, and deliberate in their actions then heretofore, it might be that his Highneſſe had learned that wary and circumſpect proceeding in <hi>Spain,</hi> where they are ſaid to uſe it in matters of far leſſe moment.</p>
               <p>They ſmiled hereat, and prayed me to continue my good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reſpects towards them, and to the joynt affairs of both our Maſters.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, I would alwaies ſerve the King my Maſter, with a true and faithful heart, and ſo far as ſhould be agreeable to his deſires, and good liking, I would to my ſmall power be ready to ſerve them.</p>
               <p>In Concluſion they ſaid, They came but to viſit me, but being come, they could not chooſe but ſay ſomething, and touch upon bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>

               <p>VVHen his Highneſſe was in <hi>Spain,</hi> being upon my journy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I went to <hi>Elis</hi>-Houſe to take my leave of <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> where <hi>Vanvail</hi> was preſent, I expreſſing much joy of the march, which in my mind would without all queſtion be perfected, did find no ſuch humour, nor inclination on their part, which did much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me; for they grumblingly did alleadge, that the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter did perform nothing that he promiſed, or how could any thing be expected the Infanta being here, whereas nothing was per formed
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:111544:146"/>the Prince being in <hi>Spain?</hi> I beſought them to do better offices, then without reaſon to put jealouſies betwixt my Maſter, and theirs, who would never have ſent his ſon to <hi>Spain</hi> without a real intention. Which onely act was reaſon ſufficient to remove all doubts.</p>
               <p>Yet did they ſtill continue their challenge of divers Bracks, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, anent the ſending of ſhips to <hi>Scotland</hi> to bring away the two <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> and not perfecting ſuch conditions as were promiſed to Catholiques. I did intreat them again, that ſuch conceits of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter might be removed, for they might be confident of full perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what he had promiſed, by reaſon he had never broke his promiſe to any. I deſired them likewiſe to conſider with what love our Prince was gone, and what a ſtain it ſhould be to the State of <hi>Spain,</hi> if uncourteouſly he ſhould return with diſtaſt; Beſides, it might fall out to be the worſt act that ever they committed, where anent if they had love to their Maſter they would prove good Inſtruments. What was ſpoke by me in Engliſh was related in Spaniſh to <hi>Don Carlo,</hi> ſo was it to me what they ſpoke in Spaniſh. Sometimes <hi>Don Carlo</hi> ſpoke in French, ſo that not a word paſſed which each man did not know.</p>
               <p>I went again after the Treaties were given up, and did remember <hi>Don Carlo</hi> of what I had foreſpoke, when the Marqueſſe was preſent and took the ſpeech; they did demand of me whether I was come of my ſelf, or by Commiſſion, for they profeſſed to account me their friend.</p>
               <p>I anſwered that I came meerly of my ſelf, and was ſorrie that by their own deſerving, they had procured ſuch alterations and I thought ſtrange of ſuch demands as they had made at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> which did both expreſſe much ſpleen, and lack of good intelligence. They did avow their demands were reaſonable; but, from that time they would make viſits to the Duke and love him better then before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were in doubt before, but now they know him to be an Enemie. I did anſwer, that I was ſorrie for their proceeding, and was their friend ſo long as they were friends to my Maſter.</p>
               <p>After a few haughty words, ſuch (as it was a wrong waie to deal with their Maſter by threatnings, who gave pay daily to 300000. Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that they had followed the wars a long time, and had ſeen men killed by the Cannon, Musket, Pike, and ſword, but never ſaw men killed with words, they deſired me to ſpeak to his Majeſtie, that they might either be diſmiſſed, or have freedome to go about their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with ſecurity. They did deſire me likewiſe to ſpeak to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, that the treatie for the <hi>Palatinate</hi> might continue.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:111544:146"/>
               <p>I did demand of them how theſe two things did agree, both to threaten and intreat? whereupon they paſſed upon me with odd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. I went once more of late to give them a farwel. I ſaid, they proved themſelves good Servants to their Maſter in preſſing to raiſe jealouſies in this State, but they were now too well known to do harm. The Marqueſſe ſwore, that by this time the Infanta had been here, &amp; the <hi>Palatinate</hi> reſtored, if the blame had not been on our Part. I did intreat I might be excuſed not to believe that. I did ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did not condemn their own judgments in accuſing the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> of that whereof he was cleared, both by the King, and State. Their anſwer was, He was cleared by thoſe who were his confiderates, all as guiltie as himſelf.</p>
               <p>I demanded, why they ſhould ſtill expreſſe their malice againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Did they not think but our Prince was a man ſenſible of what injuries he had received? their anſwer was, if the Duke were out of the way, the Prince would be well diſpoſed. They ſaid farther, his Highneſſe was an obedient ſon before the Duke guided him, but ſince, he was not. So that when we ſpeak of his Majeſtie, they ſpeak with much reſpect, but for the Prince did not uſe them kindly, they did make the leſſe accompt of him. So after I took my leave and parted.</p>

                  <salute>My moſt Noble Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>FInding matters at great uncertainty when I came hither, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make farther tryal before I ſhould part from hence. What thanks is due to the Embaſſadours for their paineful, and diſcreet Carriage can hardly be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Matters now being drawn to ſuch a conformity (which I confeſſe I thought impoſſibilities, though withall I found much reſpect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:111544:147"/>to the Prince with a ſenſible deſire of the Match expreſſed, both by the King, and thoſe I ſpake withal) our Embaſſadours ſeem ſtill to be diſcontent, that all things are not remitted to our Maſters verbal promiſe, which though it may be aſſurance ſufficient to all Catholiques, who have the ſence to conſider, that it muſt be our Maſters, and the Princes gracious diſpoſition muſt be our ſafety, more then either word or writ: yet the writ being deſired privately (as they pretend) merely to draw the Popes conſent (without the which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be finiſhed) the difference is not ſo great, their Princely promiſe being given already.</p>
               <p>What cauſe of jealouſie the refuſing hereof ſhould procure, you may conſider: beſides, my judgment failes me, if a more eaſie way ſhall be aſſented unto upon this ſide. If the Embaſſadours have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred themſelves to get this out of the publique Articles, I can bear witneſſe. Thus much I dare avow, that neither time nor place have been omitted by them to do good; though I muſt confeſſe, what intelligence I had in the proceeding, hath rather been from the <hi>French</hi> then from them. Their Reaſons (as I conceive) was their doubts, that did bring me hither, having neither Letters from the King, the Prince, nor your Grace.</p>
               <p>Whereupon to remove theſe conceits, I ſhewed them, that I did onely take this in my way, intending to go ſee the Jubilees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with though his Majeſtie, nor the Prince, neither yet your Grace were acquainted with at my parting, you will be pleaſed to make my excuſe. I am infinitely beholding to the Embaſſadours noble Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, which I know hath proceeded from that relation which they know I have to you.</p>
               <p>My Lord, let the happineſſe which ſhall come to the Prince by matching with ſuch a Lady, as I proteſt before God, hath thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to my thinking, can hardly be equalled, be a means to haſten a happy Concluſion; And let not matter of Ceremonie draw delayes where the ſubſtance is agreed upon. So ſhall all that belong to our Maſter be made happy, in general, and you in particular, for that love which they expreſſe here to your ſelf.</p>
               <p>Once more I humbly begg, you will conſider particularly upon each one of the Articles, and I hope you ſhall not find ſuch unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable difference as an affected Puritan may pretend. Whereupon if I have looked more with eyes of a Papiſt then was fitting, it is my lack of judgment, and not of zeal to my Maſters Honour, which of all carthly things ſhall be preferred. Beſeeching God to give a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

               <p>He underſtandeth that the <hi>Theologos</hi> have perſiſted preciſely upon the <hi>Voto,</hi> which they gave before, and he findeth clearly that the Prince conceiveth, that he can by no means ſubmit himſelf thereunto with his Honour. And beſides, my Lord the King hath expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to return with all poſſible ſpeed, in caſe that <hi>Voto</hi> ſhould not be qualified. And it is certain that he will depart for <hi>England</hi> within very few daies. And whoſoever ſhall inform your Majeſtie, that the Treatie of this marriage may be really kept on foot after the departure of the Prince upon theſe terms, doth deceive your Majeſtie through the ignorance wherein he is of the State of <hi>England.</hi> So that the Prince departing thus, the Catholique Subjects of all my Lord the Kings Dominions are to be in lamentable caſe. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Prince did yeſterday vouchſafe to have Compaſſion of me in reſpect of the grief wherein he ſaw I had upon theſe occaſions, and to ſay, That although the marriage were broken, yet he would procure that his Catholique Subjects ſhould not fare the worſe for that; yet I know that it is morally impoſſible for that honourable deſign of his to take place in reſpect of the People, and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie and malice of the Puritans, and eſpecially becauſe it will now be a caſe of meer neceſſitie for my Lord the King, to run in a courſe of very ſtraight Conjunction with them of his Parliament, that he may be able the better to ſerve himſelf of them in other occaſions: from which Parliament, as now the caſe will ſtand, what Catholique can expect any other then the extreamitie of rigour?</p>
               <p>In conſideration whereof I caſt my ſelf with a ſad heart at the feet of your Majeſtie, beſeeching you, that you will take into your royal
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:111544:148"/>remembrance the love, which you owe, and procure to paie to our holy Mother, the Church, and that ſome courſe may be taken, and with ſpeed (for otherwiſe it will be too late to give the Prince ſome foot of ground upon which he may be able to ſtand in ſuch ſort, as that without loſſe of honour, and breach of that word, which he hath given to the world, and without prejudice to that obedience, which he oweth to the leaſt commandement of the King his Father; his Highneſſe may be inabled to comply with the incomparable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he beareth the Infanta your Majeſties Siſter. And that by meanes hereof the two Crowns may be kindly in perfect union, and the Catholique religion may be highly advantaged, not only in the Dominions of my Lord the King, but in many other parts of Chriſtendom, into which the Authority of theſe Dominions doth flow.</p>
               <p>For my part, I take the eternall God to witneſſe, whom I procure to ſerve, and who hath given me a heart, which diſclaimeth from all other intereſſes then to ſerve God, and my King, that I conceive my ſelf not to comply with a good conſcience without laying this proteſtation under the Eye of your Majeſtie, that if the Catholique ſubjects of the King my Lord ſhall grow liable to perſecution, or affliction by occaſion of breaking this Match, through the diſguſt of the King my Lord and his Councel, or through the power, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly the Puritans aſſembled in Parliament will have with him upon this occaſion, that blood, or miſerie whatſoever, it may partly be required at their hands who have adviſed your Majeſtie not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of thoſe large conditions for Catholiques which my Lord the King and the Prince have condeſcended to, and of that more then moral Securitie which they have offered for the performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, I undertake to your Majeſtie, under the pain of infamie, in caſe that be not made good which here I affirm, that if your Majeſtie will be pleaſed to give ſome ſuch ground to the Prince, as whereupon he may with Honour ſtay, and perfect the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Marriage by any ſuch way, or means, as may occur to your Majeſties royal wiſdom, the whole bodies of the Catholiques in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land both religious, and ſecular, ſhall acknowledge it as a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, and ſhall oblige themſelves to pray inceſſantly for your happie Eſtate &amp;c.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THere was no cauſe till now, why I ſhould trouble your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip with preſenting my unprofitable ſervice to you: but now I ſhall venture to do it, by reaſon of the good newes I ſhall ſend with it.</p>
               <p>For our Queen arrived here yeſterday, and I was glad at the heart to ſee her ſuch, as ſhe had ſeemed; ſhe is more grown then I had thought, being higher by half the head then my Ladie Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe. And whatſoever they ſay, believe me, ſhe ſits already upon the very skirts of womanhood. Madam, upon my faith ſhe is a moſt ſweet lovely Creature, and hath a countenance which opens a window into her heart, where a man may ſee all Nobleneſſe and Goodneſſe; and I dare venture my head (upon the little skill I have in Phyſiognomie) that ſhe will be extraordinarily beloved by our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſerve to be ſo; and that the actions of her ſelf, which are to be her own, will be excellent. Me thought I diſcerned in her countenance a little remnant of ſadneſſe, which the freſh wound of parting from the Queen Mother might have made, yet perhaps I was deceived. Her Aattyre was very plain, for ſo Great a Queen can be thought to have nothing mean about her. But I hope that amongſt many other bleſſings, which God, will have provided for us by her means, her example will be able to teach our Countrie wit in this kind.</p>
               <p>I had the happineſſe to ſee, and hear her at a ſhort diſtance, by the Commandement which my Lady of <hi>Buckingham</hi> laid upon me to interpret for her, and believe me, ſhe is full of wit, and hath a lovely manner in expreſſing it. But I confeſſe I was ſorrie with all my heart, to hear that her courage was ſo great, as to carry her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly (after my Ladie of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had taken her leave for that time) to Sea in a poore little boate in the company of her brother, whom yet, I have not had the honour to ſee. I dare give my word for her, that ſhe is not afraid of her own ſhadow, who could find in her heart to put her ſelf at the firſt ſight, upon an element of that danger, and diſeaſe for meer paſtime; Unleſſe it were perhaps that ſhe might carrie ſome Steel about her, and that there is ſome
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:111544:149"/>Adamant at <hi>Dover,</hi> which already might begin to draw her that way.</p>
               <p>I am extreamly ſorrie, that we have loſt the hope of ſeeing the two other Queens, for if they had come, we might have had beautie here as well in the preterperfect, and in the preſent tenſe, as now we have in the future.</p>
               <p>But the Queen Mothers indiſpoſition hath arreſted her at <hi>Amiens</hi> in puniſhment of that malice, wherewith ſhe diſſembled it too long at the firſt, through the extream deſire ſhe had of coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Our Queen received my Lady of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with ſtrange cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and favour, and now there is no remedy but that the King will needs defray and treat her after a high manner. And I have been told that <hi>Mounſieur</hi> will needs deſcend ſo much as to viſit her in her lodging; and the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Chevereux</hi> (being that great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, as ſhe is, both by match, and bloud) will perforce give prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not onely to my Ladie of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but to my Ladies her daughters alſo: And I aſſure my ſelf, that a leſſe puiſſant example then this will ſerve to convert our Great Ladies, even to exceed in <hi>England</hi> towards the Ladies which are ſtrangers, and do but come, and go.</p>
               <p>But the while this Court doth ſo apply it ſelf to do my Lady of <hi>Buckingham</hi> all imaginable honour, I look on it ſo, as that I am no way diſcouraged thereby from bearing devotion to the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, when I ſee that men, who are ſick of love towards the Son, are put even by a kind of Law of nature into pain, till they revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Mother.

Which danger ſhe doth foreſee, and lament, and telleth, That no <hi>European</hi> King hath ſought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound theſe bloudy home-quarrels but the King of Great <hi>Brittain.</hi> She moſt humbly deſires the reſt of the Princes, that they would Commiſerate her moſt afflicted eſtate; her Cities taken, her houſes ſpoiled, her children murthered, her Matrons and Virgins defloured, her waies full of Thieves, her Seas of Pyrates, all the helps of life taken from her in many parts, her flocks and herds ſcattered, her Tillage ceaſed, her Trade decayed, the Lawes ſilent, Learning fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, good manners ruined, neither fear of God left, nor care of men, that all things ſeem to tend to the firſt Chaos, &amp;c. And therefore ſhe doth beſeech the Princes to whoſe truſt God hath committed, not to whoſe power he hath permitted his two Wards, two Twins, the Common Wealth, and the Church as to Guardians, that they will look better to their charge.</p>
               <p>And firſt, not ſuffer the Common Wealth of Chriſtendom by their armes (at the Popes ſecret inſtigation) to be deſtroyed, and to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:111544:150"/>this end ſhe firſt uſeth the example of good Heathen Emperours to perſwade them as <hi>Auguſtus, Vespaſian, Titus, Nerva, Trajan, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus, Marcus Aurelius, Alexander Severus, Probus;</hi> that they will ſettle peace at home, and by joynt Forces make War abroad upon the Common enemy of their Kingdomes, and ſo make the Common-Wealth to Honour them, being made by them, rich in wealth, ſtrong in power, famous in glory, honeſt in manners, the felicity of every earthly Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>Now for the other Ward, or Twin, the Church, the Heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, becauſe ſhe hath before profeſſed, that as ſhe had been long a Pagan, ſo now by the Grace of God, hath long been a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and did take this to be her greateſt honour, to be the harbour of the Chriſtian Church, ſhe ſtirres them up to be more careful by the example of the beſt Chriſtian Emperours, <hi>Conſtantine, Jovinian, Gratian, Theodoſius, Arcadius, Honorius, Charlemaign,</hi> and his Sons <hi>Lotharius,</hi> and <hi>Lodovicus,</hi> to defend her from hereſies within, and from violence without.</p>
               <p>And now ſhe begins to tell them, That as one walking with others in the Sun; not thinking on it, muſt needs be Sun-burned; ſo ſhe walking with her reformed children in this new-riſen Sun of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, did feel her ſelf coloured (as it were) with the Spirit of Chriſt, by obſerving the differences between the two Churches with great indifferencie.</p>
               <p>Here becauſe ſhe hath before challenged the Pope and the Jeſuites of cruelty, and perſwading firſt, that as men they ſhould ſpare humane bloud.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as <hi>Europeans</hi> they ſhould ſpare <hi>European</hi> blood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as Chriſtians they ſhould ſpare Chriſtian blood.</p>
               <p>She is firſt thus anſwered by the Pope ſpeaking for himſelf, and his Jeſuites, That they are not the authors of ſhedding Chriſtian blood, but haeretical blood: And that her reformed ſonnes (as ſhe terms them) are not Chriſtians, becauſe they be no Catholiques; And therefore Hereticks to be taken away by death, according to the ſentence of St. <hi>Paul, Haereticum hominem post unam aut alteram admonitionem devita; Hoc eſt de vita tolle,</hi> as Cardinal <hi>Allen</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, and according to the Decree of the Councel of <hi>Lateran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where I pray you was this your Reformed Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> And as for my Jeſuites you call them bloudy, even as you call your Phyſitians bloodie, who for driving away a Peſtilential Feaver, do take more corrupt and putrified blood from the party then they would.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:111544:150"/>
               <p>And thereupon, he doth twitt <hi>Europe</hi> as an old doting <hi>Sibylla,</hi> in her youth, being the Concubine of one <hi>Taurus,</hi> whom ſhe feigned to be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to cover her fault, with the greatneſſe of her lover, who did alſo give her the name of this divided World, that by the honour of her title, ſhe might excuſe the ſhame of her fact; And bytes the fond Oratour, that put this perſon upon her, a whelp of <hi>Luthers,</hi> that makes this Minion to accuſe him before the Princes of Homicide, or an inſenſible piece of Earth to plead his Cauſe.</p>

               <p>IT is not my purpoſe to adviſe, but to attend what others ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the Match of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> but if that be broken off, and this not reſtored according to promiſe, every one may conceive that Peace muſt give place to War abroad; but with whom, and where, and how it is to be made, it is for an higher Councel, then for any private man to reſolve.</p>
               <p>Peace were beſt, if it had <hi>Nihil inſidiarum,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith; but it is to be feared that the malice of the Catholique League doth, and will hinder the work of the Kings moſt Noble and Chriſtian heart, and then it will be a War wrapt in the name of Peace.</p>
               <p>A juſt War is the exerciſe of Faith, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> well collects
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:111544:151"/>out of thoſe Wars which thoſe Worthie Kings and Princes <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. fought for their God and his <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſo war is juſt which is made for the maintenance of Gods true religion, and for the ſafety of the Common Wealth, either for the keeping of that we have, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of that we have loſt.</p>
               <p>Every one therefore doth rejoyce to ſee the King and his Subjects ſo joyned in love together, and in the purpoſe of this defence, every one I mean that is a true Chriſtian, and good ſubject; and do wiſh that two things preſently were added, care at home to Coupe up all falſe-hearted Subjects, that are known, and proviſion to meet with the ſecret, and open practiſes of ſuch forraign Enemies, as are like to abet them</p>
               <p>The good policies of the former reign in ſuch times is the beſt preſident for this, at this time. The heads were then committed <hi>liberali Cuſtodiae,</hi> divided from their inferiour parts, the Papiſts diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, their clawes pared, that they might not hurt us, the lawes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon the Jeſuites and Prieſts, fire-brands of ſedition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion withal: Or if not blood drawn of them, yet cloſe impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, or baniſhment enjoyned them.</p>
               <p>Large ſubſidies granted to prepare the Navie, and pay the armies. And a great while no war proclaimed, but brave Adventurers ſent forth as to <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>Groine,</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> &amp;c. And before Letters of repriſal granted to the Marchants to make up their loſſes, a <hi>Rowland,</hi> for an <hi>Oliver,</hi> becauſe they had granted Letters of Mart againſt us. By this meanes Carricks were brought in, the treaſure of their <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> mines laid for at their return, ſo to make war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with their own mony, till they had made the enemie ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerout,
<note place="margin">Auſbrug.</note> and to break with their banquers of <hi>Auſpurg,</hi> and <hi>Genua,</hi> that he was not able to pay his Souldiers, and garriſons; and ſtill the Low-countries ſtrongly aſſiſted, and war made upon the enemie there, or at home, at his own doores, which was more Noble, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſafe for us; for we ſtill had peace and plenty at home, though war abroad.</p>
               <p>I know not how the caſe ſtands now between us, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> but me thinks it ſhould not be very well, when nothing will ſatisfie him, but the head of him, that ſpake the truth for the good of the King and kingdom. Certainly if we break with him, as they which ſit at the Helm know what is beſt to do, he is readie to ſtrike, and will peradventure ſtrike quickly before we be fully prepared, therefore our preparations had need to be more ſpeedie, &amp; thorough, leſt we fall into the ſnare. While they were treating of peace in 88.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:111544:151"/>they did even then invade us. I pray God they have not uſed this treatie of marriage to as bad a purpoſe; for it ſeemes they never did intend it, but for delayes, and to make it ſerve their turn, they have plainly abuſed us in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> therereby. But I can ſay nothing for the preſent, yet what is to be done, it is proper to an higher judgment; onely I tell what was then, when we were enemies.</p>
               <p>I remember in 88. waiting upon the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> at <hi>Tilbury Camp,</hi> and in 89. going into <hi>Portugal</hi> with my Noble Maſter the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> I learned ſomewhat fit to be imparted to your Grace.</p>
               <p>The Queen lying in the Campe one night, guarded with her armie, the old Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh</hi> came thither, and delivered to the Earl the examination of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who was taken, and brought in by Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> which examination the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto me to publiſh to the armie in my next ſermon. The ſum of it was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Pedro</hi> being asked what was the intent of their coming,
<note place="margin">Don Pedro's Confeſſion.</note> ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered the Lords, What? But to ſubdue your Nation, and root it out.</p>
               <p>Good, ſaid the Lords, and what meant you then to do with the Catholiques? He anſwered, We meant to ſend them (good men) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly unto Heaven, as all you that are Heretiques to hell. Yea but ſaid the Lords, what meant you to do with your whips of cord, and wyer? (whereof they had great ſtore in their ſhips) What? ſaid he, We meant to whip you Heretiques to death, that have aſſiſted my Maſters Rebels, and done ſuch diſhonours to our Catholique King, and people? Yea, but what would you have done (ſaid they) with their young Children? They (ſaid he) which were above ſeven yeares old, ſhould have gone the way their fathers went, the reſt ſhould have lived, branded in the forehead with the Letter <hi>L.</hi> for <hi>Lutheran,</hi> to perpetual bondage.</p>
               <p>This I take God to witneſſe I received of thoſe great Lords up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination taken by the Councel, and by commandement deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to the armie.</p>
               <p>The Queen the next morning rode through all the Squadrons of her armie, as Armed <hi>Pallas</hi> attended by Noble Footmen, <hi>Leiceſter, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Norris</hi> then Lord Marſhal, and divers other great Lords. Where ſhe made an excellent Oration to her armie, which the next day after her departure, I was commanded to redeliver to all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie together, to keep a Publique Faſt.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:111544:152"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her words were theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>MY loving people, we have been perſwaded by ſome, that are careful of our ſafety, to take heed how we commit our ſelf to armed multitudes for fear of treachery: but I aſſure you, I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live to diſtruſt my faithful, and loving people. Let Tyrants fear, I have alwayes ſo behaved my ſelf, that under God I have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my chiefeſt ſtrength, and ſafeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my ſubiects. And therefore I am come amongſt you as you ſee, at this time, not for my recreation, and diſport, but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the midſt, and heat of the battaile to live, or die amongſt you all, to lay down for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my Honour, and my blood even in the duſt. I know I have the bodie, but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and Stomach of a King, and of a King of <hi>England</hi> too, and think foul ſcorn that <hi>Parma</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or any Prince of Europe ſhould dare to invade the borders of my Realm, to which rather then any diſhonour ſhall grow by me, I my ſelf will take up arms, I my ſelf will be your General, Judge, and Rewarder of everie one of your virtues in the field. I know alreadie for your forwardneſſe, you have deſerved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and crownes, and we do aſſure you in the word of a Prince, they ſhall be duly paid you. In the mean time my Lievetenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhall be in my ſtead, then whom never Prince commanded a more Noble or worthie ſubject, not doubting but by your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to my General, by your Concord in the Camp, and your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the field, we ſhall ſhortly have a famous victorie over thoſe enemies of my God, of my Kingdomes, and of my People.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This I thought would delight your Grace, and no man hath it but my ſelf, and ſuch as I have given it to, and therefore I made bold to ſend it unto you, if you have it not already.</p>
               <p>I would I could perſwade your Grace, either to read your ſelf, or to command your Secretarie to gather out of the Hiſtorie of <hi>Spain</hi> tranſlated into Engliſh towards the end five or ſix leaves, which hath matter of great importance fit for the Parliament, eſpeciallie for two points; the one concerning the ſetled intention of the State of <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>England,</hi> whenſoever they can get an opportunity; the other concerning the main reaſons of ſtate, which moved the Queen, and Councel, then to take upon her the protection of the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:111544:152"/>
               <p>They were of two ſorts, the firſt inherent in the Perſon of the Prince then being, which died with her, (as ſome think) the Quarrel being then between the Queen, and King of <hi>Spain, Philip</hi> the ſecond, which are ſaid to be buried in their graves; the other inherent in their eſtates, which live with them, and remain in the heart of the State of Spain againſt us, whoſoever is their King.</p>
               <p>And this appeareth by a large Diſputation of State had before the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and blab'd out by their Chronicler in many words, wherein <hi>pro et contra</hi> two do argue. The one, who proves that the <hi>Netherlands</hi> their Rebels are firſt to be conquered, that it may ſerve them as a riſe to the Conqueſt of <hi>England,</hi> and the reaſons for that project. The other, who proves, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are firſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, the ſupporters of thoſe their Rebels, and for a riſe to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Chriſtendome, and the reaſons for the project, and ſpecially for that it is more eaſie now for the diſuſe of armes in <hi>England;</hi> for that <hi>England</hi> is not now that <hi>England</hi> which it hath been, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the mean, how they may win themſelves into us by a Treatie of Marriage, as <hi>Mariana</hi> blabs it out in general, that which the Prince hath tryed, and your Grace hath uttered in Parliament in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, that <hi>Colloquia de Contractibus,</hi> are with them <hi>Mera ludibria parata tantum Regum animis, Ne noceant distinendis, dum ea quae ipſi intendunt, perficiantur.</hi> Which <hi>Guicciardine</hi> alſo doth in general affirm, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> bring more things to paſſe by Treaties, and ſubtilties, then by force of Armes.</p>
               <p>And that you may truly underſtand the full intention of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> to the ſtate of this Kingdom, and Church, I would your Grace would read a notable Diſcourſe of the late moſt Noble Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> made by the Commandment of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and debated before her Majeſtie, and her Councel concerning this point, Whether Peace or War was to be treated with <hi>Spain?</hi> The Lord <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> ſpeaking for a Treatie of Peace, to the which the Noble Queen, and her old Lord Treaſurer inclined: The Earl ſpeaking for War, becauſe no ſafe peace could be made with that State for 3. ſpecial Reaſons, which are in that Treatiſe ſet down at large, which is not fit for me yet to deliver by writing, but there you ſhall find them. Your Grace may have the book of divers Noblemen your friends. If you have it not (if I may underſtand your pleaſure) I will get it for you. It was of that effect, that it brought the Queen, and Treaſurer contrary to their purpoſe to his ſide, for the very neceſſity of the common ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:111544:153"/>
               <p>Your Lordſhip having angred them, and endeared your ſelf to us, you had need to look to your ſelf; you are as odious to them as ever the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was.</p>

               <p>Though your Grace hath placed a Noble Gentleman in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was intended to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> yet I will not deſpair of your favour, or that you will not give me ſome taſte of it, as well as to any other.

What concerns me, I will not here ſpeak of for fear I offend. My prayers ſhall ever attend you, and my curſes thoſe, that wiſh you worſe then their own ſoules.

               <p>They offer to lay wagers, the Fleet goes not this year, and that of neceſſitie ſhortly a Parliament muſt be, which when it comes, ſure it will much diſcontent you. It is wondered at, that ſince the King did give ſuch great gifts to the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Chevereux,</hi> and thoſe, that then went, how now a ſmall ſumme in the Parliament ſhould be called for at ſuch an unſeaſonable time: And let the Parliament ſit when it will, begin they will, where they ended. They ſay the beſt Lords of the Councel knew nothing of Count <hi>Mansfelts</hi> journey, or this Fleet, which diſcontents even the beſt ſort, if not all; They ſay it is a very great burthen, your Grace takes upon you, ſince none knowes any thing but you. It is conceived, that not letting others bears part of the burthen you now bear, it may ruine you; (which heaven forbid) Much diſcourſe there is of your Lordſhip here, and there, as I paſſed home, and back, and nothing is more wondered at, then that one Grave man is not known to have your Ear except my good, and Noble Lord <hi>Conway.</hi> All men ſay, if you go not with the Fleet you will ſuffer in it, becauſe if it proſper, it will be thought no act of yours; and if it ſucceed ill, they ſay it might have been better, had not you guided the King. They ſay your undertakings in the Kingdom, and your Engagements for the Kingdome, will much prejudice your Grace.</p>
               <p>And if God bleſſe you not with goodneſſe as to accept kindly, what in dutie and love, I here offer; queſtionleſſe my freedom in letting you know the diſcourſe of the world, may much prejudice me. But if I muſt loſe your favour, I had rather loſe it for ſtriving to do you good in letting you know the talk of the wicked world, then for any thing elſe, ſo much I heartily deſire your proſperitie, and to ſee you trample the ignorant multitude under foot.</p>
               <p>All I have ſaid is the diſcourſe of the world, and when I am able to judge of your actions, I will freely tell your Lordſhip my mind. Which when it ſhall not be alwaies really inclined to ſerve you, may all noble thoughts forſake me. Becauſe I ſeldom am honoured with your Ear, I thus make bold with your all-diſcerning eye, which I pray God may be inabled with power and ſtrength, daily to ſee into them that deſire your ruine.

               <p>BEfore the receipt of that Diſpatch, with which you were pleaſed to honour me from <hi>Apthorp,</hi> dated the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> I was fully determined at your return to <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> to have preſented your Grace my moſt humble and faithful ſervice, and by that means to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the knowledge in what ſtate and condition of health you had paſſed this part of the progreſſe. Your former weakneſſe, together with the dangerous temper of the ſeaſon, giving me cauſe both to doubt, and pray againſt the worſt; But I found my ſelf then to be more ſtrictly obliged to the performance of this dutie, when I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from your Grace ſo clear, and abundant a teſtimonie, as well of your good opinion, as of the truſt you repoſed in me. Obligations certainly of that nature, and of ſo large an extent as do with reaſon deprive me of all degree of libertie, and juſtly ſubject me to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtate of ſervitude, and obedience to all your Graces Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
               <p>I have diligently peruſed my Lord of <hi>Briſtols</hi> anſwer, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your Grace to communicate unto me. And although it become me not, neither will I preſume to give my opinion of the ſtrength, or weakneſſe thereof, yet will I take the liberty to ſay thus much, That I find in his caſe that to be verified which I have obſerved at other times, (to wit) That when able and prudent men come to act their own Parts, they are then for the moſt part not of the cleareſt ſight, and do commonly commit ſuch errours, as are both diſcernable and avoidable, even by men of mean abilities.</p>
               <p>Being now fallen to ſpeak of this Lord, I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to give me leave plainly and briefly to ſet before you ſome Cogitations of mine own, touching his preſent occaſion.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:111544:154"/>
               <p>Firſt, that it may be maturely conſidered, Whether the tendring him any further charge, unto which he may be able to frame a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſatisfactorie anſwer, will not rather ſerve to declare his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, then to prepare his Condemnation, and ſo inſtead of preſſing him, reflect back with diſadvantage upon the proceeding againſt him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That your Grace would be pleaſed to conſult with your ſelf, whether you may not deſiſt from having him further queſtioned, without either blemiſh to your Honour, or manifeſt prejudice to the ſervice: Conſidering that you have (to your perpetual glory) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſſolved and broken the Spaniſh partie, and rendred them without either the means, or the hope of ever conjoyning in ſuch ſort together again, as may probably give the leaſt diſturbance or impediment to your Graces waies and deſigns.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, Although his Lordſhip in ſundry places of his anſwer, eſpecially in the latter part, doth ſeem directly to violate the rule of the
<note n="*" place="margin">Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> prudent Marriner, who in foul weather, and in a ſtorm, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed (to prevent ſhipwrack) rather to pull down, then to ſet up his ſailes. Nevertheleſſe as this caſe ſtands, it deſerves to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly pondered, which of the two waies will moſt conduce to your Graces purpoſe, and is likely to receive the beſt interpretation and ſucceſs, either to have him dealt with after a quick and round manner, or otherwiſe to proceed ſlowly and moderately with him, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for a time to remain where he is, as a man laid aſide, and in the way to be forgotten. A ſtate of being (if I miſtake not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion) which will be by him apprehended equivalent to the ſevereſt and ſharpeſt cenſure, that poſſibly can be inflicted on him.</p>
               <p>Thus have I over-boldly adventured to preſent unto your Grace, theſe few Queries and Propoſals, which they might be both inlarged, and more forcibly urged; yet to avoid the being too tedious, I have choſen to omit the further inſiſting upon them, till ſuch time, as I may have the honour and felicitie of being neer your perſon. At this preſent it ſhall ſuffice, humbly to beſeech your Grace, to be aſſuredly perſwaded, that what I have now delivered in this ſubject, doth not proceed from any over indulgent reſpect I bear either to the perſon, or fortune of my Lord of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> though I ſhould not be ſorry, that like a prudent man he might by his diſcreet application to your Grace, render himſelf capable to be again readmitted to your love and favour. But the motive which hath induced me principally to uſe this plainneſſe and libertie, is the Conſideration, how important<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as I conceive) the well ordering and diſpoſing this particular, doth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:111544:155"/>concern your Graces ſervice. Unto the advancement and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof, if I may be able now, or at any time to contribute the leaſt proportion, I ſhall eſteem my ſelf moſt happie, and more then abundantly rewarded, in caſe that my right humble endeavours in that kind may receive from your Grace a favourable and acceptable conſtruction.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this Letter with a twofold prayer; firſt to you for my ſelf, that your Grace will be pleaſed to pardon this boldneſſe. Next to God for you, that he will give you health, and length of daies for his Majeſties ſervice, and the good and honour of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. I humbly crave leave to remain</p>

               <p>Between 5. and 6. of the clock upon Saturday in the evening. I received my Charge from the Lords aſſembled in Parliament, with an Order, by which I am commanded to make my appearance at the Bar upon Thurſday next by 9. of the clock in the morning

               <p>THough my preſent indiſpoſition deprives me of the Honour to attend your Majeſtie with the reſt of the Commiſſioners, with whom your Majeſty was pleaſed to aſſociate me; yet I moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſtie to give me leave in all humility to repreſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Majeſtie, what my heart conceiveth to be moſt for your Majeſties ſervice in the preſent conjuncture of your affaires. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time of my diſtemper, I have been viſited by divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of quality, who are Parliament-men, none of thoſe popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and plauſible Oratours, but ſolid, and judicious good patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, who fear God, and honour the King. Out of their diſcourſes I collect, That there are three things, which do chiefly trouble your people.</p>
               <p>The firſt, that for the ſubſidies granted, the two laſt Parliaments, they have received no retribution by any bills of Grace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that ſome of their Burgeſſes were proceeded againſt after the Parliament were diſſolved.</p>
               <p>And the third, that they miſdoubt, that when they ſhall have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied your Majeſties demands and deſires, you will nevertheleſſe proceed to the concluſion of the Spaniſh match. It would be too much importunity to trouble your Majeſtie with the ſeveral anſwers which I made to their objections, and would be too great preſumption in mee to adviſe your Majeſties incomparable wiſdome what ſhould be fitteſt to be done for your Majeſties honour, and the contentment of the people; yet if it would pleaſe my Lord the King to give his humbleſt Creature leave to give vent to the loyal fervour of his heart, reſtleſſe, and indefatigable in continual meditation of his Gracious Maſters honour and ſervice, I would thus with all humble ſubmiſſion explain my ſelf. That there is nothing which either the enemies of this State, or the perverſe induſtry of falſe-hearted ſervants could invent more miſchievous, then the miſunderſtanding: which have grown between your Majeſtie, and your people: nothing that will more diſhearten the envious Maligners of your Majeſties feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and incourage your true hearted friends, and Servants, then the removing of thoſe falſe feares, and jealouſies, which are meer imaginarie Phantaſmes, and bodies of ayr eaſily diſſipated, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe the ſun of your Majeſtie, to ſhew it ſelf clearly in its native brightneſſe, luſtre, and goodneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:111544:157"/>
               <p>God and the World do know the ſcope, and the end of all your Majeſties pious affections, and endeavours to have been no other, then the ſetling of an univerſal peace in Chriſtendom; (a felicity only proper for your Majeſties time, and only poſſible to be procured by your incomparable goodneſſe, and wiſdom) but ſince the malice of the Divel, and deceitful men, have croſſed thoſe fair wayes wherein your Majeſtie was proceeding, abuſing your truſt, and goodneſſe, (as Innocencie, and goodneſſe are alwayes more eaſily betrayed then wilineſſe, and malice) you muſt now caſt about again, and ſail by another point of the compaſſe, and I am confident your Majeſtie will more ſecurely, and eaſily attain, your Noble and pious end, though the way be different.</p>
               <p>The meanes are briefly theſe three.</p>
               <p>Firſt let your Majeſties enemies ſee, that the Lion hath teeth, and clawes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next, imbrace and invite a ſtrict, and ſincere friendſhip, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation with thoſe whom neighbourhood and alliance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt of ſtate and religion have joyned unto you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And laſt of all, caſt off, and remove jealouſies, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Majeſtie and your people.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſtie muſt begin with the laſt, for upon that foundation, you may afterwards ſet what frame of building you pleaſe. And when ſhould you begin (Sir) but at this overture of your Parliament by a gracious, clear, and confident diſcovery of your intentions to your People. Fear them not (Sir) never was there a better King, that had better ſubjects, if your Majeſtie would truſt them. Let them but ſee, that you love them, and conſtantly rely upon their humble advice, and readie aſſiſtance, and your Majeſtie will ſee, how they will tear open their breaſts, to give you their hearts, and having them, your Majeſtie is ſure of their hands, and purſes. Caſt but away ſome crums of your Crown amongſt them, and your Majeſtie will ſee thoſe crums will make a miracle, they will ſatisfie many thouſands. Give them aſſurance that your heart was alwayes at home, though your eyes were abroad; invite them to looke forward, and not backward, and conſtantly maintain, that with confidence you undertake, and your majeſtie will find admirable effects of this harmonious concord. Your Majeſtie as the head directing, and your people as the hands and feet, obeying and co-operating for the honour, ſafety, and welfare of the bodie of the State. This will revive, and reunite your friends abroad, and diſmay, and diſappoint the hopes of your enemies, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your Majeſties perſon, aſſure your eſtate, and make your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie glorious to poſterity.</p>

               <p>Pardon I moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſtie, this licentious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which the zeal of your ſafetie and ſervice, hath extorted from a tongue-tyed man, who putteth his heart into his Majeſties hand, and humbly proſtrateth himſelf at your Royal feet, as being</p>

               <p>I Find the Queen Mother hath the onely power of governing in this State, and I am glad to find it ſo, ſince ſhe promiſes, and profeſſes, to uſe it to do careful, and good offices in the way of increaſing the friendſhip that is between us, and this State, and likewiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and aſſiſt the united provinces, the which they are preparing to do fullie, and bravely; for ſhe hath now a clear ſight of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> unto the Monarchie of Chriſtendom; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the abſence of the King, who went out of this town earlie the next day after I arrived here (before I was prepared to attend him) I have been often at the <hi>Lonure,</hi> where I had the honour to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Queen Mother. She was willing to know upon what terms ſtood our Spaniſh alliance; I told her that their delayes had been ſo tedious, that they had ſomewhat diſcouraged the King, and had ſo wearied the Prince, and State, which the dilatorie proceedings in it, as that Treatie (I thought) would ſoon have an end; She ſtreight ſaid of marriage, taking it that way; I told her I believed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and I did ſo the rather, becauſe the Spaniſh Embaſſad our hath given it out ſince my comming, that the Alliance is fully concluded, and that my journey had no other end, then to haſten his Maſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, only to give them Jealouſies of me, becauſe he at this time feares their diſpoſitions ſtand too well prepared to deſire, and affect a conjunction with us. And truly his report, and inſtruments have given ſome jealouſies to the perſons of power in this State, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince they find I can ſay nothing directly unto them; yet thus much I have directly from them, <hi>Mounſieur de Vievielle,</hi> and others, (but he is the chief guider of all affaires here) That never was the affection of any State ſo prepared to accept all offers of amitie and alliance, ſo we will cleerly, and as diſingaged perſons ſeek it, as is this; but as a wiſe miniſter he ſaies, that until we have whollie, and truly abandoned the treatie with <hi>Spaiu,</hi> they may loſe the friendſhip of a brother in law, that is alreadie ſo, in hope of gaining another that they may fail of. But when we ſhall ſee it reallie by a publique Commiſſion, that may declare all diſſolved, that touches upon the way of <hi>Spain,</hi> we ſhall then underſtand their hearts not to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more joy, then that will bring them. And the Queen Mother told me ſhe had not loſt thoſe inclinations, that ſhe hath heretofore expreſſed to deſire her Daughter may be given to the Prince, with many words of value unto the King, and perſon of the Prince, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:111544:161"/>more then this ſhe could not (ſhe thought) well ſay, it being moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, for the woman to be demanded and ſought. It is moſt certain, that under-hand <hi>Spain</hi> hath done all that is poſſible to procure this State to liſten to a croſſe-marriage, but here they are now ſo well underſtood, as this baite will not be ſwallowed by them. This I have from a grave, and honeſt man, that would not be brought to juſtifie it, therefore he muſt not hear of it. It is the <hi>Savoy</hi> Embaſſadour, that is reſident here, a wiſe, and a Gallant Gentleman, who vowes this to be moſt true. So general a deſire was never expreſſed, as is here for alliance with us: and if the King and Prince have as many reaſons of State at this time, beſides their infinite affection here, to have it ſo continued, let it be roundly, and clearly purſued, and then I dare promiſe as reſpective, and ſatisfactorie a reception, as can be imagined, or deſired. And if it were not too much ſaucineſſe for me to adviſe, I could wiſh that the propoſitions of a league, and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age may not come together, but may be treated apart. For I doubt whether it may not be thought a little diſhonourable for this King to give his ſiſter conditionallie, that if he will make war upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his brother, we will make the alliance with him; on the other part, if the league ſhould be propounded here, with all thoſe reaſons of State, that are now preſſing for them to make it, they have cauſes to doubt, and ſo have we too, that we may both be interrupted in that; for certainly the King of Spain, will (if he can poſſibly) pleaſe one ſide, the which they think here may be us, with the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and we may likewiſe fear may be them, with the rendring of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> theſe being the only open quarrels we muſt ground upon. Now as long as theſe doubts may poſſeſſe us both, this will prove a tedious, and jealous work of both ſides; But if we fall ſpeedily upon a treatie, and concluſion of a marriage, the which will find (I am perſwaded) no long delayes here: neither will they ſtrain us to any unreaſonableneſſe in conditions for our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques (as far as I can find) then will it be a fit time for to conclude a league, the which they will then for certain do, when all doubts, and feares of fallings off, are by this conjunction taken away, and the neceſſity of their own affaires, and ſafety will then make them more deſire it then we, and ſo would they now, if they could think it ſo ſure, and ſo honourable for them. For the King of Spain hath ſo imbraced them of all ſides, as they fear, and juſtly, that he will one day cruſh them to their deſtruction. My Lord, I do not preſume to ſay any thing immediately to the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thorough your hands, this I know will paſſe unto him, and if he ſhould find any weakneſſe in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:111544:162"/>this that I have preſumed to ſay, let the ſtrength of your favour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thoſe accuſtomed Nobleneſſes that you have alwayes expreſſed unto</p>

               <p>I Find here ſo infinite a value of your Perſon, and virtue, as what Inſtrument ſo ever (my ſelf the very weakeſt) having ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands (as they imagine) from you, ſhall receive exceſſe of honours from them. They will not conceive me, ſcarce receive me, but as a publique Inſtrument for the ſervice of an Alliance, that above all the things in this world, they do ſo earneſtly deſire. The Queen Mother hath expreſſed, as far as ſhe thinks is fit for the honour of her Daughter, great favour and good will in it. I took the boldneſſe to tell her (the which ſhe took extreamly well) that if ſuch a propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be made, your Highneſſe could not believe, that ſhe had loſt her former inclinations, and deſires in it; She ſaid, your truſt of her ſhould find great reſpect; there is no preparation I find towards this buſineſſe but by her, and all perſwaſions of amitie made light, that look not towards this end. And Sir, if your intentions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this way, as by many reaſons of State, and wiſdom there is cauſe now rather to preſſe it, then ſlacken it) you will find a Ladie of as much Lovelineſſe and Sweetneſſe to deſerve your affection, as any creature under Heaven can do. And Sir, by all her faſhions ſince my being here, and by what I hear from the Ladies, it is moſt viſible to me, her infinite value, and reſpect unto you. Sir, I ſay not this to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:111544:162"/>your belief, but from a true obſervation, and knowledge of this to be ſo; I tell you this, and muſt ſomewhat more, in way of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon of Madam, for the impreſſions I had of her were but ordinary, but the amazement extraordinary to find her, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to God I did, the ſweeteſt Creature in <hi>France.</hi> Her growth is very little, ſhort of her age; and her wiſdom infinitely beyond it. I heard her diſcourſe with her Mother, and the Ladies about her, with extraordinary diſcretion, and quickneſſe. She dances (the which I am a witneſſe of) as well as ever I ſaw any Creature; They ſay ſhe ſings moſt ſweetly, I am ſure ſhe looks ſo. Sir, you have thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſervants here, that deſire to be commanded by you, but moſt particularly the D. of <hi>Chevereux,</hi> and Mounſieur <hi>Le Grand,</hi> who ſeek all opportunities to do you ſervice, and have Credit and power to do ſo. Sir, if theſe that are ſtrangers are thus ambitious of your Commands, with what infinite paſſion have I cauſe to beg them, that am your Vaſſal, and have no other glory but to ſerve you; as your Highneſſe, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>YEſternight being Sunday, I arrived ſafe here at <hi>Paris.</hi> I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as ſoon as I came, that the King was reſolved after ſight of the Queens Maſque (that was to be performed that ſame night,) that he would go a private journey for 5. or 6. daies to <hi>Shaut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lie,</hi> a houſe of Mounſieur <hi>de Memorancies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being deſirous therefore to kiſſe his hands before his going, and to ſee the Court in that glory and luſtre, as muſt for certain be found upon ſuch an extraordinary occaſion, I went to the <hi>Louure</hi> to the D. of <hi>Chevereux</hi> Chamber, where I found him and his Ladie apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves for the Maſque, and in ſuch infinite riches of Jewels, as I ſhall never be a beholder of the like worn by Subjects. I had not been there above an hour, but the Queen and Madam came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they ſtaid a great while. And it was obſerved, that Madam hath ſeldom put on a more cheerful then that night. There were ſome that told me, I might gueſſe at the cauſe of it. My Lord, I proteſt to God, ſhe is a lovely, ſweet, young Creature. Her growth is not great yet, but her ſhape is perfect, and they all ſwear, that her ſiſter the Princeſſe of <hi>Piemount</hi> (who is now grown a tall and a goodly Ladie) was not taller then ſhe is at her age. I thought the Queen would have put a faſhion of reſervation upon me, as not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the breach, and diſorder of the Spaniſh Treatie; but I found it far otherwiſe. She is ſo truly <hi>French,</hi> as (it is imagined) ſhe rather wiſhes this alliance, then with her own ſiſter. The King (that was ſo early to go out of the Town) took his reſt, while the Ladies were making themſelves ready; but as ſoon as he waked, he ſent for me, and purpoſed to have received me as an Embaſſadour. But I intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the D. of <hi>Chevereux</hi> before I went, to let him underſtand, that I came as an humble and thankful ſervant onely to kiſſe his Majeſties hands, and had no other end then to do him ſervice. He then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me with much freedom and cheerfulneſſe, with many queſtions how the King is ſatisfied with his Preſent by Mounſieur <hi>de Bonevan,</hi> who when I related the Kings liking, and value of it, he was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed. He commanded me to attend him to the Maſque, which was danced by 16. of the greateſt Princeſſes of <hi>France,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> only being by the Queen received amongſt them, to put a ſingular honour, and value upon her. The King with his Brother had danced a Maſque the laſt Tueſday, with the ſame number of perſons of the beſt quality; who this night were to caſt Lots, who ſhould dance with the ſixteen
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:111544:163"/>Ladies, they onely being allowed to dance with them. And all thoſe were ſo infinitely rich in Jewels, (embroiderie of gold and ſilver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here forbidden) as they had almoſt all imbroidered their cloathes as thick with Diamonds, as uſually with purle.</p>
               <p>I cannot give your Lordſhip any particular account of my ſervice in any thing, yeſternight being an unproper time for any ſuch thing: But I am adviſed by the Prince <hi>Jenvile</hi> to ſtay here till the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and I ſhall underſtand how all things ſtand, and that no mans affection is ſo ſtraight and true for the ſervice of the King and Prince as his is, who of himſelf falls into paſſionate wiſhes for an Alliance, but tells me in much libertie, they have been informed the cauſe and plot of my journey was to ſet an edge upon Spain, rather to cut off their delaies, then to cut the throat of the buſineſſe. But I gave him great ſatisfaction in that point.</p>
               <p>My Lord, theſe are paſſages of my firſt nights being here, matters of ceremonie; and yet I omit much of that. I thought theſe too ſlight to trouble his Majeſtie, or the Prince with, yet I thought it fit ſince this Meſſenger goes, to let you ſee this outward ſhow, and face of this Court, to have as much ſweetneſſe, ſmoothneſſe, and clearneſſe towards our deſigns as is poſſible. My next Letters ſhall inform you of a further ſearch made by me, the which I am confident will be of the ſame nature. And I conceive it the rather, becauſe I find them in a great alarum at the newes, that they have received from <hi>Leige,</hi> that the King of Spain makes a Fort upon the ruine there to command both that, and the Town. This they ſay hath made them more clearly ſee his vaſt ambition to inlarge his Monarchie, and do all ſpeak the careful and honeſt language of our Lower houſe men how it may be prevented.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough, the Meſſenger I dare ſay thinks too much; yet this I will add, That I will ſtudy to make it appear to the world, and your ſelf, by a thankful heart, and to God himſelf in my prayers for your Lordſhip, that I am</p>

This reputation hath begotten in the ſweet Princeſſe Madam, ſo infinite an affection to your fame, as ſhe could not contain her ſelf from a paſſionate deſiring to ſee your Picture, the ſhadow of that perſon ſo honoured, and knowing not by what means to compaſſe it, it being worn about my neck; for though others, as the Queen and Princeſſes would open it, and conſider it, the which ever brought forth admiration from them, yet durſt not this poor young Ladie look any otherwiſe on it then afar off, whoſe heart was nearer it then any of the others, that did moſt gaze upon it. But at the laſt (rather then want that ſight the which ſhe was ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of) ſhe deſired the Gentlewoman of the houſe where I am lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that had been her ſervant to borrow of me the picture in all the ſecreſie that may be, and to bring it unto her, ſaying, She could not want that Curioſitie as well as others towards a perſon of his infinite reputation. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw the party that brought it, ſhe retired into her Cabinet, calling onely her in; where ſhe opened the picture in ſuch haſte, as ſhewed a true picture of her paſſion, bluſhing in the inſtant at her own guiltineſſe. She kept it an hour in her hands, and when ſhe returned it, ſhe gave with it many praiſes of your perſon. Sir, this is a buſineſſe ſo fit for your ſecreſie, as I know it ſhall never go farther, then unto the King your Father, my Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Carliles</hi> knowledge. A tenderneſſe in this is honourable; for I would rather die a thouſand times, then it ſhould be publiſhed, ſince I am by this young Lady truſted, that is for beautie and goodneſſe an Angel.</p>
               <p>I have received from my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> an advertiſement,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:111544:165"/>that your Highneſſe opinion is to treat of the General league firſt, that will prepare the other.</p>
               <p>Sir, whatſoever ſhall be propounded will have a noble accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though this give me leave to tell you, when you are free, as by the next newes we ſhall know you to be, they will expect, that upon thoſe declarations they have here already made towards that particularitie of the Alliance, that your Highneſſe will go that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and nearer way to unite and faſten by that knot the affection of theſe Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Sir, for the general they all here ſpeak juſt that language that I ſhould, and do unto them of the power and uſurpation of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> of the approaches they make to this Kingdom, the danger of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> the direct Conqueſt of <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> By which means we have cauſe to joyn in oppoſition of the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and mightineſſe of this King. The which they all here ſay can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo certainly done as by an Alliance with us. This they ſpeak perpetuallie, and urge it unto my conſideration.</p>
               <p>Sir, unleſſe we proceed very roundly, though they be never ſo well affected, we may have interruptions by the arts of Spain, that make offers infinite to the advantage of this State, at this time. But they hearken to none of them, untill they ſee our intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. The which if they find to be real indeed, they will give us brave ſatisfaction.</p>

               <p>I Have already acquainted your Grace how generally our deſires are met with here, much more cannot be ſaid then I have already for that purpoſe. There was never known in this Kingdome ſo intire an agreement for any thing, as for an Alliance with <hi>England,</hi> the Count of <hi>Soyſons</hi> onely excepted, who hath had ſome pretenſions unto Madam, but thoſe are now much diſcouraged, upon a free diſcourſe the Cardinal of <hi>Rochfalcout</hi> made unto the Counteſſe his Mother, telling her, That if ſhe or her ſon believed, or could expect, the King would give him his ſiſter in marriage, they would (as he conceived) deceive themſelves: for he imagined upon good grounds, that the King would beſtow his Siſter that way, that might be moſt for her honour and advancement, and likewiſe for the advantage of his Crown and Kingdom; and he profeſſed for his part, although he much honoured the Count as a great Prince of the bloud, yet was he ſo faithful unto his Maſter, as he would adviſe him to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>The Queen Mother and Mounſieur <hi>Le Grand</hi> have adviſed me to ſay ſomething unto the King concerning my buſineſſe. I told them, I could ſay nothing very directly unto him, and yet would I not ſo much as deliver my opinion of the King my Maſters inclinations to wiſh an alliance with him, unleſſe I were aſſured, his anſwers might make me ſee his value, and reſpect unto him. They then ſpake unto him, and aſſured me, I ſhould in that be ſatisfied. Having that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from them, I told the King, that I had made this journey of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to declare unto him my humble ſervice and thankfulneſſe for all his Honours and favours, the which I thought I could not better expreſſe, then by informing his Majeſtie, that our Prince whom he had ever ſo much valued, would be as I conceived free, and diſ-inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from our Spaniſh Treatie, by reaſon that the King could not find them anſwer his expectation in thoſe things that made him princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſire their Conjunction; the which your Lordſhip ſeeing you have exerciſed your intereſt and credit with the King your Maſter, and the Prince to convert thoſe thoughts towards his Majeſtie, from whom, you were perſwaded nothing but truth and honour would be returned, the which at this time more then ever, would be an infinite advantage to both theſe Kingdoms, and that I believed if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:111544:166"/>would ſhew a diſpoſition, as affectionate to receive Propoſitions to this purpoſe, as the King my Maſter had to make them, a long time would not paſſe before the effects of this might appear, the which would ſhew the report raiſed here of the ends of my coming to be falſe, and me to be free of all other deſigns, then thoſe which I had expreſſed unto him. He told me, that he had not heard, that the Spaniſh Match was yet broken, the which juſtly might give him cauſe to be reſerved; yet thus far be would aſſure me in the general, That whatſoever ſhould be propounded unto him from the King of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> he would moſt heartily and affectionately receive it: but this was with ſuch a faſhion of Courteſie, as ſhewed that he deſired cauſe to have ſaid more, and I am fully ſatisfied not onely from him, but the Queens, and moſt of all of Madam her ſelf, who ſhewes all the ſweetneſſe and contentment that may be, and likewiſe from all the Officers of the Crown, and State, that they can deſire nothing equal with this alliance. A better and more large preparation then this my inſtructions cannot make, and I wonder to ſee it thus fair, conſidering the hinderances and defacings the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadour deſires to caſt upon it, who beſides the <hi>Rodomontado's</hi> and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the preparations of his Maſter, doth here take a contrary, but cunning way, letting them know, that the Prince cannot have two Wives, for their Infanta is ſurely his, onely to create a jealouſie and ſhieneſſe in them towards me, that he ſuſpects labours to do offices that are not to his liking.</p>
               <p>You will therefore I hope ſpeedily put this State out of theſe doubts, and clearly and freely proceed with them. Upon my credit and reputation, they are all of that diſpoſition, that we can wiſh them to be, and it appears by their tender care of the States, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to ayd them: And likewiſe in ſending Captain <hi>Coborn,</hi> that came from the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> to demand a ſupplie of men, who is returned with anſwer unto him, that he ſhall have double what he required, and great ſatisfaction to the Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> that ſent a Gentleman hither, to let the King know, he was not yet in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, but that he could aſſemble his Troops to ſuch a number, as might do his Majeſtie good ſervice, if he would be pleaſed to take him into his protection and favour.</p>
               <p>And the King hath ſent a Gentleman of the Religion a <hi>Sedanois</hi> to <hi>Leige,</hi> to give information to this State of the proceedings of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there, and to be ready to receive (if the Town ſhall ſeek it) the protection of them. But theſe paſſages I am ſure you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually underſtand from our Embaſſadour, the which makes me omit
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:111544:167"/>many particularities in this kind that I could inform you of. I have ſent this Bearer of purpoſe, the which I beſeech your Grace return with ſome ſpeed, and with him the reſolutions of our dear and Sacred Maſter, whom God ever bleſſe and keep to our glorie and comfort.</p>

               <p>ACcording to his Majeſties order which your laſt of April the 14. derived unto me, I have repreſented ſuch reaſons to the King, and his miniſters of State here, againſt the ſending of any perſon, in what quality ſoever, to the Duke of <hi>Baviers,</hi> as they acquieſce in them; ſpeciallie for that they come commanded under his Majeſties deſire, which they profeſſe to be very willing to comply with, not only in this, but in any other occaſion wherein his Majeſtie may directly, or indirectly be any way intereſſed.</p>
               <p>I took the ſame opportunity of preparing the way a little farther to a formal treaty of alliance, by feeling once again their pulſe in matters of religion, and find, that it beats ſo temperately, as promiſes a very good Criſis of any thing that may concern that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p>I dealt plainely with the Marqueſſe <hi>de la Veiville</hi> touching the courſe that his Majeſtie may be driven to hold againſt Jeſuites and Prieſts, of baniſhing them the Kingdom; and of quickning the lawes againſt the other Catholiques, as well out of neceſſity of reducing them within the bounds of ſobriety and obedience, as of keeping good intelligence with his Parliament, without which he could not poſſibly go thorough with ſuch a weighty work, as he is now to undertake. He approved of the courſe for the ends ſake; under hope notwithſtanding that his Majeſtie would not tie his own hands
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:111544:167"/>from ſome moderate favour hereafter, which is all they pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and deſire it may flow from the mediation of this State upon an alliance here, for the ſaving of their honour, who otherwiſe will be hardly reputed Catholiques.</p>
               <p>In repreſenting a facility in theſe things, I leave no other difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be imagined.</p>
               <p>Their good inclination to the match in general they are willing to demonſtrate, (as by many other evidences, ſo) by the care, they are now under of lodging, and defraying my Lord of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and my ſelf in a more ſplendid and Magnifique manner, then ever yet they did any Embaſſadour whatſoever, for ſuch is the language that <hi>Ville-aux Cleres</hi> holds to me upon that ſubject.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> ſees it, and ſtormes, and manifeſts his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content towards me (who am the inſtrument) more fellie then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly. I encountred him the other day, and gave him the due that belonged to his rank, but inſtead of returning me my ſalute, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfullie turned back his head. I was ſomewhat ſenſible thereof, and I told <hi>Mounſieur de Grandmont</hi> of it, and as he, and I were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of it the day following, <hi>Soiſſons</hi> offered himſelf full butt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us a ſecond time. I again repeated my courteſie, and he is childiſh in civility. <hi>Grandmont</hi> found it ſtrange, and intimated to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <hi>de la Valette</hi> a familiar, and confident of the Counts both my obſervation, and his own diſtaſte of ſuch an uncivil kind of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Valette</hi> conveyes the ſame to <hi>Soiſſons</hi> himſelf, who anſwered that he could not afford me a better countenance, not for any ill will he bore unto my perſon, but to my errand and negotiation; which (were it not in the behalf of ſo great a Prince) went ſo near his heart, as he profeſſed, he would cut my throat if he could. Nay, were any Prince of <hi>Savoy, Mantova,</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> here in perſon to ſollicit for themſelves in the like nature, he would hazard his life in the cauſe. Such is the language that deſpaire brings forth, which put me into an expectation of no leſſe then a challenge to decide the quarrel. And I once verily believed it ſent, for the Count <hi>de Lude</hi> came very ſo berly to me, and told me, he had a meſſage to deliver me from a great Perſonage, which he intreated he might do without offence.</p>
               <p>I deſired him to ſpeak freely what it was, and from whom He told me he was ſent by the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and I preſently replyed that nothing ſhould come amiſſe from him. In concluſion the errand was to ſignifie an extream liking, that the Count took to one of my Horſes, which he was deſirous to buy of me upon any rate. I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:111544:168"/>that if the Count would expreſſe to me his deſire himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him of guift, he ſhould be at his ſervice, otherwiſe he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill as he was. Since that I have met him, &amp; been prevented with a very courteous ſalute from him. I have been thus ample in theſe particular paſſages betwixt the Count and my ſelf, that by the trouble you find in his diſconſolate breaſt, you may judge of the conſtancie of Madams heart towards our Prince, upon whom aſſuredly it is moſt ſtrongly ſet, (as ſhe continually expreſſes upon all occaſions.) Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday I had the honour to entertain her two hours together, and received ſo many teſtimonies of reſpect, as witneſſed very warm af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards the Perſonage I did repreſent. Amongſt other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, She fell to ſpeak of Ladies riding on horſeback, which ſhe ſaid was rare here but frequent in <hi>England,</hi> and then expreſſed her delight in that exerciſe.</p>
               <p>There is lately arrived here a French Genleman (<hi>Duport</hi> by name) with commiſſion from the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to ſollicit this Kings favour (in conſequence of his Majeſties generous, and Gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in his behalf) for the recovering of his rightful inheritance, to intreat that <hi>Baviers</hi> may no wayes be countenanced in his unjuſt pretenſions, and to crave (in this his extreamity) a reimburſement of the remainder of that ſum, which his father lent to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth in the times of his neceſſities, which may ariſe to the ſum of 30000 Crownes; the facilitating of this negotiation is recommended unto me, who contribute what I can to the good ſucceſſe thereof. There hath happened here this laſt Munday a diſpute between the Marquis <hi>de Courtenvant</hi> one of the firſt Gentlemen of the Kings Chamber, and the Colonel <hi>de Ornano</hi> (<hi>Mounſeiurs</hi> Governour) about a lodging, which this pretended unto as moſt convenient for him, in regard that it adjoyned to that of <hi>Mounſeiurs;</hi> but the other claimed a right unto it by a former aſſignation, and poſſeſſion. <hi>Ornano</hi> at the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, till the other complained to the King, who commanded the Colonel to quit the lodging to him; which his people refuſing (out of a preſumption perhaps, that the commandement was rather formal then real) the King ſent 3. or 4. of his guard to reiterate the commandement, and in caſe of refuſal to obey, to caſt out all the ſtuff, and to kill all ſuch as ſhould oppoſe. Thus <hi>Courtenvant</hi> got the day; perhaps by <hi>Vievilles</hi> recommendation in oppoſition of <hi>Toirax,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom, there hath been lately a little conteſtation upon this occaſion. <hi>Vieville</hi> being deſirous to ſtrengthen himſelf, and to ſtand upon the ſureſt bottom he could, endeavoured to joyn a confident of his in equal commiſſion with the <hi>Garde des Seaux,</hi> that ſo he might
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:111544:168"/>in time work it out, and prevail himſelf of that office at his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Garde des Seaux</hi> finding feeble reſiſtance in himſelf, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed his courſe to <hi>Toirax</hi> to ſeek under his Covert ſhelter from that diſgrace, and injurie. <hi>Toirax</hi> undertakes his defence; <hi>Vieville</hi> expoſtulates the matter with him, and alleadges many reaſons to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his intentions, which the other gaineſaying, with ſome little warmneſſe, hath occaſioned by that heat, a coldneſſe of affection between them ever ſince, and that ſo far forth, as it hath grown to be notorious.</p>
               <p>To the ſame original, I reduce the Cardinal <hi>de Richlieus</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into the Councel of the Cabinet by the favour of <hi>Vieville</hi> (being made alſo an Inſtrument thereunto by the Queen) that by making his own partie ſtrong in Councel, he may the more eaſily cruſh any adverſarie, that ſhall grapple with him. Yeſterday he was admitted; ſo that now that Councel is compoſed of the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Cardinal <hi>de la Rouch-foulcant, Richlieu,</hi> the Conſtable <hi>Vieville,</hi> and the <hi>Garde des Seaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I had finiſhed this Letter, I had occaſion to viſit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, to whom I uſed the ſame language, that formerly I had done to <hi>la Vieville,</hi> and with the like approbation. And when I touched upon the point of diſpenſation, how it might be paſſed over, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me in general, that ſuch was the diſpoſition of this King, and State to give the Prince content, as he might be (in a manner) his own Carver how he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>This is the account I can give you of the publique: but how ſhall I expreſſe the deep ſenſe I have of my obligations to your favour in particular? ſhall I multiply in thanks? It is too ordinary a payment for ſo many Noble expreſſions of your love. I will rather endeavour by my deeds conſtantly and continually to witneſſe unto you, that I intirely reſt</p>

               <p>BEſides that joynt Letter to your Lordſhip from my Colleague, and my ſelf, I think fit to add this particular account of what paſſed yeſterday at <hi>Ruel</hi> betwixt Queen Mother, and me; whither going to give her double thanks; as for the libertie, ſhe had given me of acceſſe at all times to Madam, to entertain her henceforth with a more free, and amorous kind of language from the Prince; ſo for having ſo readily condeſcended to an humble ſuit of mine in the behalf of my Lord of <hi>Carlile</hi> for a favourable Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to your Lordſhip; ſhe was pleaſed to oblige me farther in relling me ſhe did it meerly for my ſake. I redoubled my thanks, and added, that I knew your Lordſhip would eſteeme it one of the greateſt happineſſes that could befal you to have an occaſion offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereby you might witneſſe, how much you adored her Majeſties royal virtues, and how infinitely you were her Servant, readie to receive law from her, whenſoever by the leaſt ſyllable of her bleſſed Lips or Penn, ſhe ſhould pleaſe to impoſe it. And this I did (as on the one ſide to gratifie my Colleague, who would be infinitely ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the diſgrace he apprehends in the miſſe of the <hi>Ribbon,</hi> being thus brought upon the Stage for it) as alſo to help to meſnage that your Gratious favour which <hi>Mounſieur de Fiatts</hi> to my Lord repreſents unto him, by giving you meanes withal to oblige this ſweet &amp; bleſſed Queen, who hath your Lordſhip in a very high account, and would be glad to find occaſions how ſhe may witneſſe it. The mention of my Lord of <hi>Carlile</hi> upon this occaſion refreſhed her remembrance of the late falling out betwixt the Cardinal and him; and though ſhe were ſufficiently informed of the particulars by the Cardinal himſelf, yet ſhe would needs have a relation from me, who in a merrie kind of faſhion obeyed her command, and ſalved every thing the beſt I could. She would needs know my opinion of the Cardinal, who ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to her his wiſdom, his courage, his courteſie, his fidelity to her ſervice, his affection to our buſineſſe as pleaſed her not a little. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did my heart and my tongue differ, for I eſteem him ſuch. This diſcourſe ſhe left to fall upon a better ſubject, the Prince, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whoſe voyage into Spain, the cenſure of <hi>Italie</hi> (ſhe ſaid) was, that two Kings had therein committed two great errours. The one in adventuring ſo precious a pledge to ſo hazardous an enterpriſe, the other in badly uſing ſo brave a gueſt. The firſt, Madam, (anſwered I) may be excuſed from the end, the common good of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:111544:169"/>which then ſtanding upon deſperate tearmes, had need of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate remedie. The ſecond had need of a better advocate then I, to put any colour of defence upon it.</p>
               <p>But his Highneſſe had obſerved as great a weakneſſe and follie as that, in that after they had uſed him ſo ill, they would ſuffer him to depart, which was one of the firſt ſpeeches he uttered after he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the ſhip. But did he ſay ſo? ſaid the Queen. Yes Madam I will aſſure you (quoth I) from the witneſſe of my own eares. She ſmiled, and replyed, Indeed I heard he was uſed ill. So he was (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I) but not in his entertainement, for that was as ſplendid as that countrie could afford it, but in their frivolous delayes, and in the unreaſonable conditions, which they propounded, and preſſed (upon the advantage they had of his Princely Perſon.) And yet (ſmilingly added I) you here (Madam) uſe him far worſe. And how ſo? preſently demanded ſhe? In that you preſſe (quoth I) upon that moſt worthie, and Noble Prince, (who hath with ſo much affection to your Majeſties ſervice, ſo much paſſion to Madam ſought this Alliance.) The ſame, nay more unreaſonable conditions then the other, and what they traced out for the breaking of the match you follow, pretending to conclude it very unſeaſonablely in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of time, eſpeciallie when the jealouſies, that ſuch great changes in ſtate, are apt to beget, are cunningly fomented by the Spaniſh Embaſſadour in <hi>England,</hi> who vaunts it forth, that there is not ſo great a change in <hi>La Vievilles</hi> particular perſon, as there is in the general affections, which did but follow before the ſtream of his Greatneſſe and credit.</p>
               <p>Thus caſting in the Kings mind the ſeed of doubts, whereunto the <hi>Conde de Olivares</hi> in Spain hath been willing to contribute by this braving ſpeech to our Royal Maſters Embaſſadour there, That if the Pope ever granted a diſpenſation for the match with <hi>France,</hi> the King of Spain would march with an armie towards <hi>Rome</hi> and ſack it. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rayement nons l'en empeſcherous bien</hi> (promptly anſwered She) <hi>Car nous lui taglierous aſſez de beſongne ailleurs. Mais qu'est-ce qui vous preſſe le plus.</hi> I repreſented unto her the unfitneſſe of the ſeventh Article (even qualified by that interpretationt, hat it is) and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of the laſt which requires, and preſcribes an oath. And deſired that the honour of the Prince (with whom ſhe pretended a will to match her Daughter) might be dearer to her, then to be bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced with that, which could add nothing to their aſſurance. I alſo humbly beſought her to imploy her Credit with the King her ſon, her authority to the Miniſters for a reformation of thoſe two Articles
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:111544:170"/>eſpecially, and a friendly, and ſpeedy diſpatch of all.</p>
               <p>And if we muſt come to that extreamitie, that more could not be altered, then already was, yet at leaſt ſhe would procure the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this proteſtation by the King our Maſter, when he ſhould ſwear them, that he intended no further to oblige himſelf by that oath, then might well ſtand with the ſafety, peace, tranquility, and conveniency of his State. This ſhee thought reaſonable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſpeak with the King and Cardinal about it. And if you ſpeak as you can (replied I) I know it will be done, Though when all is done, I know not whether the King my Maſter will condeſcend ſo far yea, or no. Here I intreated I might weary her Majeſtie no further, but take the libertie ſhe had pleaſed to give me in entertaining Madam with ſuch Commandments as the Prince had charged me withall to her. She would needs know what I would ſay. Nay then (ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling quoth I) your Majeſtie will impoſe upon me the like Law that they in <hi>Spain</hi> did upon his Highneſſe. But the caſe is now different (ſaid ſhe) for there the Prince was in perſon, here is but his Deputie. But a Deputie (anſwered I) that repreſents his perſon. <hi>Mais pour tout cela (dit elle) qu' eſt ce que vous direz? Rien (dis-re) qui ne Soit digne des oreilles d'vne ſi vertueuſe Princeſſe. Mais qu' eſt ce?</hi> redoubled ſhe? Why then Madam (quoth I) if you will needs know, it ſhall be much to this effect; That your Majeſtie having given me the libertie of ſome freer Language then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I obey the Prince his Command, in preſenting to her his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, not by way of Complement any longer, but out of paſſion, and affection, which both her outward, and her inward beauties (the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of her mind) ſo kindled in him, as he was reſolved to contribute the uttermoſt he could to the Alliance in queſtion, and would think it the greateſt happineſſe in the world, if the ſucceſſe thereof might miniſter occaſion of expreſſing in a better, and more effectual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer his devotion to her ſervice; with ſome little other ſuch like amorous Language. <hi>Allez, Allez, Il n'y a point de danger en tout cela</hi> (ſmilingly anſwered ſhe) <hi>je me fie en vous, je me fie en vous.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I abuſe her truſt, for I varied not much from it, in delivering it to Madam, ſave that I amplified it to her a little more, who drank it down with joy, and with a low Curteſie acknowledged it to the Prince; adding, that ſhe was extreamly obliged to his Highneſſe, and would think her ſelf happie in the occaſion, that ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented of meriting the place ſhee had in his good Graces.</p>
               <p>After that, I turned my ſpeech to the old Ladies that attended, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old them, That ſith the Queen was pleaſed to give me this liberty, it
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:111544:170"/>would be henceforth fit for them to ſpeak a ſuitable Language.

               <p>THis Bearer your Couſen's going is in ſuch haſte, as what you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from me muſt be in very few words. I was yeſterday with the Marqueſſe <hi>de Vieville,</hi> whom I find cordial to do good offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ours, and this Kingdome; and he aſſures me by all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and proteſtations that may be, he will ever uſe his credit and power to do ſo, knowing theſe Kingdoms can (as the King of Spain's power and ambition increaſes) have no true ſafetie and ood, unleſſe we joyn in friendſhip and alliance. He is very free to me, telling me, That to prevent this, the King of Spain offers now the largeſt conditions of ſatisfaction and friendſhip that can be imagined, but their thoughts here are wholly bent towards us; And although as yet, the King cannot with honour or wiſdom ſay more then he hath done, yet we may be aſſured when we are free, to be ſatisfied in all we can deſire.</p>
               <p>This day I underſtand the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> is like lightning paſſed by
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:111544:171"/>for <hi>Spain,</hi> and by a ſpecial Command from the King it is to put us in more terrour; That he will uſe his ſervice in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where I believe he hath little credit and power to offend us. But howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they omit nothing that may diſhearten us, but we are of too noble and conſtant a temper, either to fear their cunning or power.</p>
               <p>My Lord, give me leave to beſeech you, not to defer our buſineſſe, for never can this State be found ſo rightly and truly inclined in love and affection towards us. And the rather haſten it, becauſe all the art that may be is daily uſed from <hi>Spain</hi> to prevent us, and if we go not roundly and clearly with them here, they may have jealouſies and diſcouragements that may change them: Take them therefore now, when I dare promiſe they are free, very free from thoſe thoughts.

               <p>VVEE have made a final concluſion of this great Treatie. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what terms the diſpatch at large will ſhew your Grace: We have concluded honourably, that which we could not do ſafely; for to receive words, that obliged not, would have appeared an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and unperfect Treatie of our part, and no way worthy of the greatneſſe of our Maſter, nor the paſſion of his Highneſſe, the which now hath a brave expreſſion, ſince his Miſtreſſe is only conſidered, and deſired, and the only object of our Treatie. But I muſt tell you, that ſince we have proceeded thus, they ſay, they will out-go us in the like braverie, doing ten times more then we expect, or they durſt promiſe, fearing the World would conceive all their doings condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally; the which would be diſhonourable for Madam.

               <p>VVE are in all the pain that may be, to know what to anſwer to the malicious and continual complaints made by <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> of wrongs and violences done him, even to the aſſaulting of him in his own lodging, the which he hath repreſented with ſo much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, as it took great impreſſion here in the hearts of all, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Queen Mother, whom yeſterday I ſaw in the accuſtomed priviledge hath ever been given me, to have at all times my entrance free into the <hi>Louure.</hi> And I the rather went, becauſe I would not ſhrink at all their furies and clamours, and it came to ſuch a height, as Petitions were given by Madam <hi>de Blanvile,</hi> that ſhe might for the injuries done to her husband his Embaſſadour, have ſatisfaction upon our perſons. But ſhe was (as ſhe deſerved) deſpiſed for ſo paſſionate a follie, yet was it in confideration (as I ſuſpect) by a word that the Queen Mother uttered in her paſſion to me, who with tears before all the World, being accompanied by all the Princeſſes and Ladies, told me, (but ſoftlie) That if your Majeſtie continued to affront, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch indignities to be done to the Embaſſadour of the King her Son, your Majeſtie muſt look that your Embaſſadours ſhall be uſed <hi>a la pareylie.</hi> I confeſſe this ſtirred me ſo much, as I told her, That if the intentions of your Majeſtie were no better conſidered by the King here, your Majeſtie commanding us for the good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Kingdom, to endeavour to bring, and give him (the which we have done) the greateſt bleſſing in this World, Peace in his Countrie, then to be ballanced with a perſon, that in requital hath ſtirred up, and dailie deſires to do it, diſputes, and jarres, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Majeſtie, and the Queen, we had reaſon to believe your Majeſtie moſt unjuſtly, and moſt unworthily requited. And it might take away upon any ſuch occaſion, the care, that otherwiſe you would have had to do the like. And for my part, it took from me all deſire ever to be imployed upon any occaſion hither, where our Actions, that their acknowledgments have been acceptable but a few daies paſt, are now of ſo little conſideration, as we are of no more weight, then the unworthieſt Miniſter that ever was imployed. Upon that I found, ſhe was ſorrie for having expreſſed ſo much. But this day we had from her a more favourable audience, and from the King the effects and circumſtances of that which we have in our Diſpatch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto my Lord <hi>Conway.</hi>

               <p>Sir, the malice of this <hi>Blanvile</hi> is ſo great unto your worthie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant my Lord Duke, as he hath written a private Letter unto the King, the which I ſaw by the favour of a friend, that he is in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of danger to be ruined by the furie and power of the Parliament. And to confirm him in that opinion, hath ſent all the paſſages amongſt them that concern my Lord Duke; adding to that, of great factions againſt him at the Councel Table, and naming ſome Lords, the which makes me ſee, he hath intelligence with all thoſe, that he believes may contribute any thing towards the miſchieving of him. But thoſe that know the magnanimitie and nobleneſſe of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties heart, know that ſo noble a veſſel of honour and ſervice as he is, ſhall never be in danger for all the ſtorms that can threaten him: when it is in your Majeſties hands not onely to calm all theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, but to make the Sun, and beams of your favour to ſhine more clearly upon his deſervings then ever, the which upon this occaſion your courage and virtue will no doubt do, to the encouragement of all deſerving, and excellent ſervants, and to his honour and comfort that is the moſt worthie that ever Prince had: And ſo affectionate, that the world hath no greater admirations, then the fortunes that the Maſter and ſervant have run together. And certainly our good God will ever preſerve that affection, that in ſo many accidents, and one may ſay afflictions, hath preſerved your Perſons.</p>
               <p>Sir, this boldneſſe, that I take, proceeds not from the leaſt doubt theſe fooliſh rumours give me of changes, but out of a paſſionate meditation of thoſe accidents, that your courage and fortune hath carried you through, bleſſing God for your proſperitie, the which will be by his grace moſt glorious, and laſting, according to the prayers of</p>

               <p>THis Meſſenger is ſo rigid, and ſuch an enemie to all <hi>Jantileiſe,</hi> as by him I will not ſend any news in that kind; but when the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Mercurie</hi> comes, you ſhall know that which ſhall make you joy, and grieve that you cannot injoy what your fate and merit hath ſo juſtly deſtined unto you. We have ſuch daily alarums here out of <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Blanvile,</hi> of the beating of his ſervant, and at the laſt the danger, that of late he himſelf hath been in, of being aſſaſſinated in his own houſe; for the firſt word that his ſervant ſaid unto the King, and the whole Court was, The Embaſſadour had run ſuch a bazard of his life, as no man that heard him believed he had eſcaped with leſſe then 5. or 6. wounds. Inſomuch as your friend <hi>Bouteve</hi> asked, <hi>Fait vn belle fine:</hi> And this hath ſo animated this Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as your Lordſhip knowes) apt upon all occaſions to be fired, and ftirred up, as the King hath been moved to forbid us our entries, and liberties here. And yeſterday Madam <hi>de Blanvile</hi> did openly petition the King to impriſon us for the wrongs and injuries done unto her husband, and his Embaſſadour, that ſhe feared was by this time dead. But that had no other effect but to be laught at. I never (I confeſſe) ſaw the Queen Mother in ſo much diſtraction and paſſion, for ſhe never ſpeaks of her Daughter but with tears, and yeſterday with ſome heat and bitterneſſe to me about it: the Circumſtances I have taken the boldneſſe to preſent unto his Majeſtie. That which diſtracts me infinitely, is to hear, that they do traduce you as the cauſe of all theſe misfortunes, and that you ſtirre up the King to theſe diſpleaſures. And ſo much impreſſion it hath made into the Queen Mother, as this day at the audience ſhe told me. That you had made the marriage, and were now, as ſhe imagined, and was informed, reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your work. I asked her what particularitie could make her ſay, and believe ſo againſt the general, and continual actions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that the whole world ought to be ſatisfied of your infinite care, and affection, to faſten and tye together a good, and conſtant intelligence and friendſhip between theſe Crowns. She told me, that you intreated Madam <hi>de St. George</hi> to do ſome ſervice for you to the Queen, the which ſhe did, and inſtead of giving her thanks, you threatned the ſending of her away. I told her, Though I had as yet heard nothing of this particularitie, yet I knew your nature to be ſo generous, as you would never do any action unjuſt. I told her, that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:111544:173"/>ſhe muſt diſtinguiſh between what you ſay as Commanded by the King, and what you ſay of your ſelf: for if it be his pleaſure to make the inſtrument to convey his will upon any occaſion of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, you are not to diſpute, but to obey his Command in that, and in all other things. I told her farther, that I ſaw the continual ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Embaſſadour, that invents daily injuries and falſhoods of your Lordſhip, to unload himſelf from his inſolencies and faults; but I hoped that nothing ſhould light upon your Lordſhip, but what you deſerved, the which to my knowledge was more value and eſteem, then any man in the world could, or can ever merit from this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And I deſired her, not to entertain the belief of theſe things too haſtily, until we had newes out of <hi>England,</hi> that we knew would contradict all theſe malitious diſcourſes. And I muſt tell your Grace, that by a friend (whom I am tyed not to name) I was ſhewed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Lettter that <hi>Blanvile</hi> wrote to the King, in the which he ſent him the whole proceedings of the Parliament; and concludes they will ruine you, naming great factions againſt you, and as it were a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to deſtroy you. But I hope he, and the whole world here will fall, before any misfortunes ſhould fall upon ſo generous, and ſo noble a deſerver of his Maſter, and ſo excellent a friend and Patron unto</p>

We muſt only uſe our power with thoſe of the Religion, to humble them to reaſonable Conditions, and that done, they would as far as I can gueſſe have us gone, not being willing that we ſhould be ſo much as in the Kingdom, when the Peace is made, for fear the Proteſtants may imagine, we have had a hand in it. For our Confederation, made by you at the <hi>Hague,</hi> they ſpeak ſo of it, as they will do ſomething in it, but not ſo really or friendly as we could wiſh. But for theſe things, you allow me, (I truſt) to refer you to the general Diſpatch: I come now to other particulars; I have been a careful Spie how to obſerve intentions, and affections towards you. I find many things to be feared, and none to be aſſured of a ſafe and real welcome. For the

<note place="margin" type="runSum">king</note> continues in his ſuſpects, making (as they ſay) very often diſcourſes of it, and is willing to hear <hi>Villanes</hi> ſay, That

<note place="margin" type="runSum">the heart</note> hath infinite affections, you imagine which way. They ſay there is whiſpered amongſt the fooliſh young Bravado's of the Court, That he is not a good <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that ſuffers

<note place="margin" type="runSum">anchor</note> to return out of <hi>France,</hi> conſidering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that are raiſed, many ſuch bruits flie up and down. I have ſince my coming given Queen Mother by way of diſcourſe occaſion to ſay ſomewhat concerning your coming, as the other night when ſhe complained to me, That things were carried harſhly in <hi>England</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>France;</hi> I then ſaid, That the greateſt unkindneſſe and harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe came from hence, even to forbid your coming hither, a thing ſo ſtrange, and ſo unjuſt, as our Maſter had cauſe, and was infinitely ſenſible of it. She fell into diſcourſe of you, deſiring you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and love her daughter; and likewiſe that ſhe had, and would ever command her to reſpect you above all men, and follow all your Councels (the matter of her Religion excepted) with many profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of value and reſpect unto your Perſon; but would never either excuſe what I complained of, or invite you to come upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:111544:174"/>But though neither the buſineſſe gives me cauſe to perſwade your coming, nor my reaſon for the matter of your ſafetie; yet know you are the moſt happie, unhappie man alive, for
<note place="margin" type="runSum">the heart</note> is beyond imagination right, and would do things to deſtroy her fortune, rather then want ſatisfaction in her mind. I dare not ſpeak as I would, I have ventured I fear too much, conſidering what practiſes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the malice of the people here. I tremble to think whether this will find a ſafe conveyance unto you. Do what you will, I dare not adviſe you; to come is dangerous, not to come is unfortunate. As I have lived with you, and only in that enjoy my happineſſe, ſo I will die with you, and I proteſt to God for you, to do you the leaſt ſervice, &amp;c.</p>

Secondly, to ſpie and diſcover what he can; and (according as he ſhall find cauſe) to frame Cabals, and factions, whereunto he is eſteemed very proper, being charactarized with the marks of a moſt ſubtile, prying, penetrating, and dangerous man.</p>
               <p>And therefore as an Antidote againſt the poiſon he brings, the Duke gives this Caveat aforehand, That every one keep cloſe, and covert towards him, and avoid familiaritie with him, though (otherwiſe) he wiſhes a kind and honourable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thus much I received from the Dukes own lips yeſternight; (<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocil</hi> being witneſſe, perhaps Counſellour of all that paſſed) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a memorial in writing this day, which I have attended till this evening, and even now receive it.</p>
               <p>I have not touched the leaſt ſyllable hereof to my Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> becauſe I think both your Graces, and the Duke <hi>de Cheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux's</hi> will may concur in this, that theſe things be not ſubject to many eyes.</p>

               <p>TO read and conſider two contrary advertiſements; the one given me on Munday evening by <hi>des Porches,</hi> who repeating what he had told me before, <hi>(D'avoir deſtrompé la Royne mere en mil, et mil choſes)</hi> aſſured me, that her thoughts were now ſo far changed from what they were, as ſhe remitted every thing to his Majeſties pleaſure to do what he liſt, (provided, that he attempted not upon the conſcience of the Queen her Daughter, which was the only point ſhe was tender in, and ſcrupulous) that ſhe had written a very ſharp Letter, full of good leſſons, and inſtructions to her, that ſhe had as clear a heart to your Grace, as was poſſible; had ſent for <hi>Blanvil</hi> expreſſely to alter his inſtructions, and that howſoever he (like a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-hearted man) had uttered in confidence to a friend of his, That he would perſwade the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to put on a reconciled countenance for a time, till the way ſhould be better prepared to give your Grace a dead lift, yet the Queen Mothers intentions were aſſuredly ſincere and good. The <hi>Savoyards</hi> Embaſſadours voyage was not then reſolved, but his Secretarie prepared to make it in his room. Of whom <hi>Pocheres</hi> (by the way) gave this touch. That there was a great correſpondence between <hi>Madamoiſelle de Truges,</hi> and him (contracted upon occaſions of frequent viſits, that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her Mother, and the Embaſſadour) and that therefore a careful eye was to be had of him.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:111544:176"/>
               <p>Another (who muſt be nameleſſe) ſent for me yeſterday in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone to tell me, that <hi>Pere Berule's</hi> errand hither was only to make out-cries againſt the decree, or proclamation againſt the Catholiques, and to accuſe your Grace as the Principal, if not the only author, who was now of a ſeeming friend become a deadly foe. That the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> had (out of his reſpect unto this State) purpoſely abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf, that he might not be guilty of ſo pernicious a Councel. That your Grace and my Lord of <hi>Holland,</hi> had both but very ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery hold in his Majeſties affections; that if this King would imploy his credit as he might, it would be no hard matter to root you both out thence, that there were good preparatives for it alreadie, and that my Lords <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Pembroke</hi> would joyn hands and heads together to accompliſh the effect. Whereupon <hi>Blainville</hi> was ſent for back to be more particularly inſtructed in the waies how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it; and would ſpeedily poſt away in diligence. The ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty added, that the propoſitions which the Marqueſſe <hi>de Fiatt</hi> had made bout the League, and Fleet, were before <hi>Brule's</hi> arrival ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what well taſted, but ſince ſlighted, as thoſe, that became cheap (by their offer to divers others, as well as them) that the ſaid Marqueſſe ſhould have viſited <hi>Blainville</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſounded him about his errand after this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether he had order to diſneſtle Madam <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>George?</hi> Whereto the anſwer was, No; and that it was againſt all reaſon of State ſo to do; and when the other replyed, that the world was come to a bad paſſe, if reaſon of State deſcended as low as her, <hi>Blainville</hi> remained ſilent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether he had commiſſion to introduce the <hi>Dutcheſſe</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Counteſſe of <hi>Denbigh</hi> into the Queenes bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber. Anſwer was made, that it was a nice, and tender point, and if that were once condeſcended to, they would be continually whiſpering in the Queenes ear, how dear ſhe would be to the King her Husband, how plauſible, and powerful among the people, how beloved of all, if ſhe would change her religion, againſt which they were in conſcience here bound to provide, and therefore conclude with a refuſal of that likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether he carried any good inſtructions about an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, or defenſive league whereunto the negative was ſtill repeated; but that he carried brave offers for the entertainment of <hi>Mausfelt.</hi> And when the Marqueſſe replied, that if that were all the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he carried, he feared ſhe would find but a very cold welcome; the other added, that perhaps he might be an Inſtrument to make
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:111544:176"/>the Queen and Duke friends. This were good (quoth the Marqueſſe) if the Queen had not as much need of the Dukes friendſhip, as the Duke of hers, and upon theſe terms they parted. The ſame lips that utterred all this, gave caution likewiſe againſt the <hi>Savoyard</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, as a cunning, deep, hollow-hearted man. And being felt by me, how his pulſe beat towards <hi>Porcheres,</hi> told me he was a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarie man, and no wayes to be truſted. In the iſſue of all this, his Councel was, That your Grace would conſider well your own ſtrength, and what ground you have in his Majeſties favour, If it be ſolid, and good, then a Bravado will not do amiſſe (may be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful here, to make them to ſee their own errour, and to walk upright) ſo it end with a good cloſe: but if your ſtation be not ſure, then he Counſels to prevent the ſtorm; for to break with all Spain, <hi>France,</hi> Puritanes, Papiſts, were not wiſdom; And deſires that by any meanes you inſtantly diſpatch a Currier to me to repreſent the true ſtate of things at home, and how you deſire matters ſhould be ordered for your ſervice here abroad, ſo that there may be fabriqued a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid contentment to your Grace whoſe, hands I moſt humbly kiſſe in quality of</p>

                  <p>As I was cloſing up my Letter, Mr. <hi>Gerbier</hi> arrived, who hath been ſomewhat indiſpoſed in his health by the way, but now is reaſonably well God be thanked. His coming is very ſeaſonable, and I aſſure my ſelf will be uſeful.</p>

               <p>NOw, that, I thank God for it, his Highneſſe according to my continual prayers, hath made a ſafe, and happie return, unto your Sacred Majeſties preſence, I think my ſelf bound by way of Compleat obedience to theſe Commandements I received from your Majeſtie, both by Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert,</hi> and my Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> to give your Majeſtie an account of that ſenſe, which the general ſort of people doth entertain here concerning the whole frame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of his Highneſſe voyage. It is agreed on all parts, that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt have received much contentment, in ſeeing two great Kingdomes, and conſequently in enjoyning that ſatisfaction, which Princes, but rarely, and not without great peril, obtain. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe diſcretion, diligence, and Princely behaviour every where likewiſe is much praiſed. Laſtly, ſince his Highneſſe journey hath fallen out ſo well, that his Highneſſe is come back, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to his perſon, or dignity, they ſay the ſucceſſe hath ſufficiently commended the Councel. This is the moſt common cenſure (even of the biggeſt party, as I am informed) which I approve in all, but in the laſt point, in the delivery whereof I find ſomething to diſlike, and therefore tell them, that things are not to be judged alone, by the ſucceſſe, and that, when they would not look ſo high as Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without which no place is ſecure, they might find even in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State, ſo much, as might ſufficiently warrant his Highneſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and liberty to return.</p>
               <p>I will come from the ordinary voice to the ſelecter judgement, of the Miniſters of State, and more intelligent people in this Kingdom, who, though they nothing vary from the above recited opinion, yet as more profoundly looking into the ſtate of this long treated of Alliance betwixt your Sacred Majeſtie, and Spain, in the perſons of his Highneſſe, and the Infanta, they comprehended their ſentence thereof (as I am informed) in three Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the proteſtation which the King of Spain made to his Highneſſe upon his departure, whereby he promiſed to chaſe away,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:111544:177"/>and disfavour all thoſe, who ſhould oppoſe this marriage, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no further, then to the ſaid Kings Servants, or at furtheſt, not beyond the temporal Princes, his Neighbours, ſo that the Pope being not included herein, it is, though his conſent muſt be yet obtained, and conſequently, that the buſineſſe is in little more forwardneſſe then when it firſt began.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Pope will never yield his conſent, unleſſe your Sacred Majeſtie, grant ſome notable priviledges and advantage to to the Roman Catholique religion in your Sacred Majeſties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the ſaid King of Spain would never inſiſt, upon obtaining thoſe priviledges, but that he more deſires, to form a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in your Sacred Majeſties Kingdomes, which he may keep alwaies obſequious to his will, then to maintain a friendly correſpondence between your Sacred Majeſtie, and himſelf. I muſt not in the laſt place omit to acquaint your Sacred Majeſtie, very particularly, with the ſenſe which was expreſſed by the <hi>bons Francois,</hi> and bodie of thoſe of the Religion, who heartily wiſh, that the ſame Greatneſſe which the King of Spain doth ſo affect over all the world, and ſtill maintaines even in this country, which is to be Protector of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited, and Bigott partie, your Sacred Majeſtie would imbrace, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defender of our faith. The direct anſwer to which, though I evade, and therefore reply little more, then that this Counſel was much fitter, when the union in <hi>Germany</hi> did ſubſiſt, then at this time? Yet do I think my ſelf obliged to repreſent the affection they bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Sacred Majeſtie. This is as much as is come to my notice, concerning that point, your Sacred Majeſtie gave me in charge, which therefore I have plainely layd open, before your Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties eyes, as underſtanding well, that Princes never receive greater wrong, then when the Miniſters, they put in truſt, do palliate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe thoſe things, which it concerns them to know. For the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof let me take the boldneſſe to aſſure your Sacred Majeſtie, that thoſe of this Kings Councel here, will uſe all meanes they can, both to the King of Spain, and to the Pope (In whom they pretend to have very particular intereſt) not only to interupt, but if it be poſſible to break off you Sacred Majeſties Alliance with Spain. For which purpoſe the Count <hi>de Tilliers</hi> hath ſtrict command, to give al punctual advice, that accordingly they may proceed. It reſts, that I moſt humbly beſeech your Sacred Majeſtie to take my free relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe particulars in good part, ſince I am of no faction, nor have any paſſion, or intereſt; but faithfullie to perform that ſervice;

The verie day the Prince arrived at St. <hi>Anderas,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me verie weak, told me he was verie ſorrie, I was not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the journie for <hi>England,</hi> for that now there was an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion of a diſpatch, not only in reſpect of the ratification come the night before; but becauſe alſo they were almoſt come to a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concluſion of all articles, which were to be engroſſed, and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the next day. Hereupon I was inquiſitive to know what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he had the Ratification was come: He anſwered, that, that verie day, he had been ſummoned to attend the <hi>Junto,</hi> and that there they had earneſtlie preſſed him, that the Articles might be ſpeedilie drawn up, and ſigned, ſince they had now received full warrant to authorize them to proceed; And that the next day was appointed accordingly. Thereupon unwilling to omit the preſent opportunitie, conceiving withal the purpoſe of the Princes Letter to be, either to expreſſe his Highneſſe further pleaſure before the meeting of the <hi>Junto,</hi> or to prevent the concluding of ſome other particular Article they might otherwiſe fall upon: I delivered his Letter to his Lordſhip (pretending it came to my hands amongſt other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that ſame day) I found him exceedinglie troubled in reading it, nor did he forbear to tell me, it muſt for a time be concealed; for he
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:111544:178"/>feared, if they ſhould come to the knowledge of it they would give order to ſtay the Prince. Upon theſe motives, and in this manner I parted with it, wherein I humbly ſubmitting my ſelf to his Highneſſe Conſtruction, I remain.</p>

               <p>IF I preſume too much, I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to pardon me, eſpecially in preſuming to write to ſo great and worthie a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who hath been told that I have done him wrong. I heard it but of late, but moſt happie had I been, if I might have diſproved, that villanie againſt me, when there had been no ſuſpition, that the deſire to ſave my life, had preſented my excuſe.</p>
               <p>But my worthie Lord, it is not to excuſe my ſelf that I now write: I cannot; for I have now offended my Soveraign Lord: for all paſt,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:111544:179"/>even all the world, and my very enemies have lamented my, loſſe, whom now if his Majeſties mercie alone do not lament, I am loſt. Howſoever, that which doth comfort my ſoul in this offence is, that even in the offence it ſelf, I had no other intent then his Majeſties ſervice, and to make his Majeſtie know, That my late enterpriſe was grounded upon a truth, and which with one Ship ſpeedily ſet out, I meant to have aſſured, or to have died; being reſolved (as it is well known) to have done it from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> had I not been reſtrained. Hereby I hoped not onely to recover his Majeſties gracious opinion, but to have deſtroyed all thoſe malignant reports which had been ſpread of me. That this is true, that Gentleman whom I ſo much truſted, (my Keeper) and to whom I opened my heart, cannot but teſtifie, and wherein if I cannot be believed living, my death ſhall witneſſe: Yea that Gentleman cannot but avow it, that when we came back towards <hi>London,</hi> I deſired to ſave no other Treaſure, then the exact deſcription of thoſe places in the <hi>Indies.</hi> That I meant to go hence as a diſcontented man, God I truſt, and mine own Actions will diſſwade his Majeſtie. Whom neither the loſſe of my eſtate, thirteen years impriſonment, and the denial of my pardon could beat from his ſervice, nor the opinion of being accounted a fool, or rather diſtract, by returning as I did, ballanced with my love to his Majeſties perſon, and eſtate, had no place at all in my heart.</p>
               <p>It was that laſt ſevere Letter from my Lords for the ſpeedie bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me up, and the impatience of diſhonour, that firſt put me in fear of my life, or enjoying it in a perpetual impriſonment, never to recover my reputation loſt, which ſtrengthened me in my late, and too late lamented reſolution, if his Majeſties mercie do not abound: if his Majeſtie do not pitie my age, and ſcorn to take the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt and utmoſt advantage of my errours: if his Majeſtie in his great charitie do not make a difference between offences proceeding from a life-ſaving-natural impulſion, without all ill intent, and thoſe of an ill heart; and that your Lordſhip, remarkable in the world for the Nobleneſſe of your diſpoſition, do not vouchſafe to become my Interceſſour, whereby your Lordſhip ſhall bind an hundred Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of my kindred to honour your memorie, and bind me for all the time of that life which your Lordſhip ſhall beg for me, to pray to God that you may ever proſper, and over-bind me to remain</p>

               <p>MY humble heart and affection hath wrote many lines, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented many Petitions to your Grace before this time, though none legible but one ſent by my Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> within five daies after your moſt welcomed arrival from <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have learned the plain phraſe of honeſt ſpeech. My Lord, I have honoured your name long, and your own virtue much. I never found misfortune greater then this, that ſtill ſailing after you in all humble deſires of dutie, I was ſtill caſt behind you. I excuſe nothing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Grace may judge me faultie, but will be glad to expiate my errours at any price.</p>
               <p>Your noble heart (I hope) harbours no memorie of what did then diſtaſte you. Your own merits which have ſo much ennobled you, will be the more compleat, if I may but merit your forgetfulneſſe of wrongs paſt. If I ſeek your Grace before I deſerve it, enable me I beſeech you to Deſerve, that I may ſeek. If any, on whom you have caſt your eye moſt, endear himſelf more to your ſervice, then I ſhall; let me not follow the vintage at all. Till this day I feared the relliſh of ſowr Grapes, though I have ſought you with many broken ſleeps. But this Noble Earl, whoſe honour for this work ſhall ever with me be ſecond to yours, hath revived me, with the aſſurance of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pardon, and libertie to hope, I may be deemed your ſervant.</p>
               <p>I proteſt to God, it is not the affluence of your honour makes me joy in it, nor the power of your Grace, that trains me on to ſeek it, but let the trial of all your fortunes ſpeak thus much for me, that I will follow you, not as <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Captains and Souldiers followed him, the one for ſpoil, the other for place: but if with ſafetie to your Grace, though with peril to my ſelf, I may ſerve you, let me die if I do it not, rather then want any longer, what my humble love ever led me to, and I ſtill affect the honour</p>

I ſhall not ſeek to gloſſe them now, but as they have been, leave them to your Graces acceptance, which I preſume ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſcandal or detraction cannot decline it.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:111544:181"/>the guilt of the accuſed, but the legal and juſt proceeding, which cleares the Kings honour, and this I do, and ever will acknowledge to have been held towards me. Neither was it ever known, that the Kings Grace, the more it came ſweetned with his favour, did leſſen or diminiſh his honour, but rather ſeemed as a luſtre to make his goodneſſe ſhine brighter, and oblige the Receiver in a more ſtrict Tye of gratitude. My Lord, it cannot wrong you to oblige me to your ſervice, nor add reputation to you throw me upon Rocks. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the King, and your own Conſcience, whether ever I have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured any treaſonable thoughts, either againſt his Majeſtie, or his iſſue, that ſhould make me uncapable of receiving his grace, without imputation to thoſe faithful and dutiful reſpects, with which I have ever ſerved his Majeſtie; If it ſhall pleaſe him to line me out my path to death (the period whither we muſt all travel to) by impriſonment, I ſhall be far from repining at the ſentence, but with all humbleneſſe, will undergo it, and employ my heartieſt prayers for the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his honour and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>I beſeech your Lordſhip receive my Character of what I am, and have ever been towards you, not from Conjectures and reports of others, but from my own mouth, and actions. For yet I have reaſon to ſuſpect your opinion of me, elſe ſure I ſhould have found better fruits of your power. I was alwaies (as much as lay in me) deſirous to outſtrip, rather then come ſhort of any in doing you ſervice, and the ſame affections ſtill remain with me, of the truth of which I pray you be confident.</p>

               <p>THough you may judge what pleaſure there is in the converſation of a man in the diſtemper you ſee your Brother in; yet the dutie I owe to a husband, and the affection I bear him, (which ſickneſſe ſhall not diminiſh,) makes me much deſire to be with him, to adde what comfort I can to his afflicted mind, ſince his onely deſire is my Companie. Which if it pleaſe you to ſatisfie him in, I ſhall with a very good will ſuffer with him, and think all but my dutie, though I think every wife would not do ſo. But if you can ſo far diſpenſe with the Lawes of God, as to keep me from my Husband, yet aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it not by reſtraining from me his means, and all other content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but which I think is rather the part of a Chriſtian, you eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ought much rather to ſtudie comforts for me, then to adde ills to ills, ſince it is the marriage of your Brother makes me thus miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For if you pleaſe but to conſider not only the lamentable eſtate I am in, deprived of all Comforts of a husband, and having no means to live of: beſides falling from the hopes my fortune then did promiſe me, for you know very well I came no beggar to you, though I am like ſo to be turned off.</p>
               <p>For your own honor, and Conſcience ſake, take ſome courſe to give me ſatisfaction, to tye my tongue from crying to God, and the world for vengeance for the unworthy dealing I have received. And think not to ſend me again to my Mothers, where I have ſtayed this quarter of a year, hoping (for that my Mother ſaid you promiſed.) order ſhould be taken for me, but I never received pennie from you. Her confidence of your Nobleneſſe made me ſo long ſilent; but now believe me, I will ſooner begg my bread in the ſtreets to all your diſhonours, then any more trouble my friends, and eſpecially my Mother, who was not onely content to afford us part of the little means ſhe hath left her, but whileſt I was with her, was continually diſtempered with deviſed Tales, which came from your Familie, and withal loſt your good opinion, which before ſhe either had, or you made ſhew of it; but had it been real, I cannot think her words would have been ſo tranſlated, nor in the power of diſcontented ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Tales to have ended it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, if the great honour you are in, can ſuffer you to have ſo mean a thought as of ſo miſerable a creature as I am, ſo made by too much Credulitie of your fair promiſes, which I have waited for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of almoſt theſe five years: And now it were time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,

No man in the bodie of ſtorie, is a full preſident to you, nor may any future man promiſe himſelf and adaequation to his precedent, if he make you, his. Kings have diſcerned the ſeeds of high virtues in many men, and upon that Gold, they have put their ſtamp, their favours upon thoſe perſons: But then thoſe perſons have laboured under the jealouſie of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Heire; And ſome few, have had the love of Prince, and King, but not of the Kingdom, and ſome of that too, and not of the Church; God hath united your Grace ſo to them all, that as you have received obligations from the King, and Prince, ſo you have laid obligations upon the Church and ſtate. They above, love you out of their judgement, becauſe they have loved you: and we below, love you out of our thankfulneſſe, becauſe you have loved us. Gods pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Seal is the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, and his broad-Seal is the outward beſſings of this life.

               <p>I Find that all my Lord of <hi>Briſtols</hi> actions are ſo much extolled, that what you command me to ſay is hardly believed. I will ſay no more in it, but leave the reſt to Mr: <hi>Greihams,</hi> only this, that you have written much to the King in ſome mans behalf, and Mr. <hi>Greſley</hi> hath a 100. a year given him during his life, all which I think is without your knowledge; And Mr. <hi>Killegrew</hi> hath the like, that came for your ſake after the other was granted. Mr. <hi>Greihams</hi> can tell you how that came. My Lord of <hi>Southampton</hi> hath offered his ſon to marrie with my Lord Treaſurers Daughter, and tells him this reaſon, that now is the time he may have need of friends, but it is refuſed as yet; the event I know not what that will be.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken to the King of all that you gave me in command, and he doth proteſt, that what he hath done, was meerly for your ſake, and indeed he is very careful of all your buſineſſe, as if you were here your ſelf; but yet for Gods-ſake make what haſte you may home for fear of the worſt. For the carriage of Captain <hi>Hall,</hi> I will not trouble you, till you come home, only this by the way, that my Lord Treaſurer hath it; but upon what tearms I know not nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſire you ſhould be troubled with it. Sir <hi>George Goring</hi> came home but this laſt night, and is gone to the Court, and deſires to be excuſed for writing to you. My Ladie <hi>Hatton,</hi> and my Ladie <hi>Purbeck</hi> came home with him from the Hague.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Arundel</hi> hath not been at Court ſince the death of his ſon. I fear the newes, that <hi>Charles Gleman</hi> did ſhew you was true.

Pray have a care of the Letter, I mean the man Mr. <hi>Gle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> did ſhew you, and keep as many friends as you may. I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with no man, but my Lord Keeper who is yours, or not his own as he ſweares. And Mr. ſecretarie <hi>Conway</hi> is yours bodie, and ſoul; I never heard of the like of him, for he flies at all men, that be not yours. Here is much admiration, that they hear not from you, but I thank God, the King is not troubled at it, for I do aſſure him, that it is the better, that he heares not from you: for now he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that you keep your day in comming away, which doth much pleaſe him. I will write nothing of my own buſineſſe, though there be nothing done in it, but do hope, that you will not ſee your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant periſh.</p>

               <p>BY the diſpatch of the fourteenth of this preſent (which I ſent by <hi>Jonſon</hi> the Poſt) I advertiſed your Honour at large in the two ſeveral Letters of the occurrents of theſe parts, and therewith ſent a copie of my ſecond propoſition which I made the day before in the Aſſemblie of the States General touching the buſineſſe of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and <hi>Juliers</hi> in conformitie to your Honours Letters of the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the laſt.</p>
               <p>The anſwer thereunto was deferred until yeſterday, and then brought me only by word of mouth from the States by <hi>Mounſieur Magnus</hi> of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Mounſieur Zuleſtein</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and was to this effect, That the States having ſent my former propoſition of the third of <hi>December</hi> to their ſeveral provinces, from which this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did differ in ſubſtance, ſave onely in reſpect of the time for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Townes, which was prolonged for the ſpace of a month, all they could do according to the conſtitution of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was to ſend this my ſecond propoſition likewiſe unto their provinces, which they had done the day after I made the ſame, and until they receive more expreſſe order from their principals, they were to reſt upon their former anſwer. Wherein they declared their
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:111544:184"/>good intentions to accommodate this buſineſſe, ſo it might be with ſafetie to themſelves, and ſatisfaction of their neighbours. And herein they were to expect the reſolution of the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> from whom the time did not yet ſerve, to know his mind. Mean while they humbly beſeech his Majeſtie to make a gracious conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their proceedings.</p>
               <p>I was the day before with Mounſieur <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> (who is Preſident this week) to ſollicite their anſwer, who excuſed himſelf upon the ſmalneſſe of their number, many of the States being abſent, and of two Provinces all the Deputies: So as to give a determinate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according as was required, they could not: And to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in general terms, ſince his Majeſtie reſted not ſatisfied with the former, he doubted another of the ſame kind would not pleaſe him. So as it ſeems this Meſſage in place of an anſwer in writing, proceeded of his Councel.</p>
               <p>By diſcourſe both with him, and thoſe which came unto me, upon this ſubject, I find their diffidence of the purpoſe of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſed then otherwiſe, upon the news of Leavies intended on the Arch-Dukes ſide, to the number of 9000 foot, and 1000, or 1200 horſe; and their delay in taking a determinate reſolution, no way diſſwaded, but rather counſelled by all other Princes, who have intereſt in this buſineſſe. Their Embaſſadour at <hi>Paris</hi> having adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed them by reiterated Letters, That <hi>Don Pedro di Sarmientos</hi> his offer to his Majeſtie touching the execution of the Treatie of <hi>Zanten</hi> is abſolutely diſavowed by both the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> And this <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour <hi>Mounſieur du Maurier,</hi> having made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto them, that at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> they have the ſame conceit of it, as a thing done without authoritie. Beſides, the Princes of the Union have written lately expreſſe Letters to the States, wherein they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to extraordinarie vigilance upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this buſineſſe of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and <hi>Juliers,</hi> the tranſlated Copies of which Letters, I ſend your Honour herewith. And the Prince of <hi>Brandenbergh</hi> being young himſelf, and having his Councel divided in opinion, doth nothing abſolutely without reference to this State, and he when I put them in mind, how they themſelves were the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and framers of the Treatie of <hi>Zanten,</hi> they ſtick not to ſay plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Temporamutantur, et nos:</hi> ſo as I am daily more and more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in my former opinion, That there is no way left to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date this buſineſſe, but by a private agreement between the Princes Pretendents. But <hi>Strickius,</hi> the Agent of <hi>Brandenbergh,</hi> being abſent at <hi>Cleves,</hi> I do not hear how this Negotiation proceeds.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:111544:184"/>
               <p>Amongſt the particularities which paſſed in diſcourſe between <hi>Mounſiour Maguns,</hi> and my ſelf, I inſiſting upon reſtitution of the Townes, as the meanes to prevent an imminent war upon the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, He asked to whom they ſhould reſtore them, unleſſe the Princes were agreed, and that they might know, which of the Princes ſhould receive him, and whom they ſhould have for their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Whereby it appeares, this courſe will on this ſide remove all difficulties.</p>
               <p>It is advertiſed hither, by <hi>Mounſieur Langrack,</hi> the States Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour at <hi>Paris,</hi> that the apprehenſion they had in the Court, to have this buſineſſe ended without the French Kings intervention, cauſed <hi>Mounſieur de Refuges</hi> to be ſummoned to make an other journey ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely hither, in regard he had formerly the managing thereof, Notwithſtanding that <hi>Mounſieur de la Nove</hi> was already named for this extraordinarie Embaſſage: But <hi>Refuges</hi> excuſing himſelf upon his indiſpoſition, ſent all his memorial of what paſſed, when he was here in the treatie of <hi>Zanten,</hi> with his private opinion upon the whole matter to ſerve as an inſtruction to <hi>la Nove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the other Letters of the 28. of this preſent <hi>Stil No. Mounſieur Langrack</hi> hath given this State many important advertiſements, as firſt, that he hath obtained of the <hi>French</hi> Kng a continuance of the ſuccours of the 3. Regiments of foot, and 2. Troops of horſe of that Nation for one year longer, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and Arch-Dukes Embaſſadours, who adviſed the recalling of them upon occaſion of the preſent troubles in <hi>France.</hi> That there is order given and aſſignation for 120000 Crownes towards the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages of their pay. That a reſolution is taken in that Court by the advice of the new Councellours, contrarie to the opinion of the old, to proſecute the Princes by war, and maintain the Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity henceforward by force. That to this effect the King deſires the State ſhould perform their promiſes of ſending towards the river of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> 5. men of war. That he likewiſe requires of them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of the laſt treaties betwixt the Crown, and this Stat, an aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of men to the number of the <hi>French,</hi> which are here in ſervice, under ſome good Commander; But the <hi>French</hi> themſelves, the King will not have, for fear, when they ſhall come into <hi>France,</hi> of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting to the Princes. That he demands free paſſage through theſe Countries down the <hi>Mauſe,</hi> and the <hi>Rhene</hi> of 3000. Souldiers, with their armes, which are leaived by the Count <hi>John Giacomo Belioyoſa</hi> in <hi>Luke-Land,</hi> and thereabouts, and ſhipping to tranſport them into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:111544:185"/>
               <p>All theſe particulars were moved unto him (as he writes) by the Marſhal <hi>de Anchre,</hi> to which he adds, That the King is ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt the Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> for ſeeking to this State for protection, by theſe Letters whereof I advertiſed your Honour in my laſt, that there is a reſolution taken to declare him <hi>Criminel de leſe Majeſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Grauntes</hi> are ſo ſcantie (the continuance of the <hi>French</hi> Troops in the ſervice of the State, being but for a year only, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them arriving only to the tenth part of what is alreadie due) that they here interpret them to proceed from the <hi>Marſhal de Aucre Pour tenir</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>le bee en Leau,</hi> and the demands are ſo large and extravagant, that they are thought <hi>iniquum petere, ut aequum ferant;</hi> Whereby on the one ſide to keep this State in devotion to the <hi>French</hi> King, and on the other to prevent the like requeſts of the Princes: for there is ſmall appearance, they will give paſſage to ſo many men through their Countries armed, and commanded by an <hi>Italian,</hi> who hath born armes againſt them, and is married into the Arch Dukes Countrie. And when it comes to queſtion of ſending forces of their own thither, it is like they will find as good excuſes for that point, as they have hitherto done for the ſending of the ſhips, now three months ſince promiſed, and ſtill ſolicited: For howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the chief Perſons here have been long particularly intereſted and ingaged (as your Honour knowes) by neer dependance on this Crown, I find them of late very much alienated in conſideration that it is ſo much governed by Spain, which in the end they apprehended will turn to the ruine of this State.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> they are jealous of this coldneſſe, and have of late expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulated the matter with <hi>Mounſieur Langrack,</hi> as if they here did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the Princes, there being, a bruite raiſed in <hi>Paris,</hi> that Count <hi>Maurice</hi> would go in Perſon to their aſſiſtance; whereof the Queen Regent was very ſenſible; but I do not find here, that there was any ground for that report.</p>
               <p>Here hath been lately a fame ſpread, and nouriſhed by ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to weaken the correſpondence betwixt his Majeſtie and this State, that his Majeſtie is in neer terms of matching our Prince with Spain. Which report is now the more credited, by an adviſo out of Spain from a ſecret Miniſter, this State entertaines, under colour of ſolliciting Merchants cauſes. That this match hath been there, by order of the King of Spain debated in the inquiſition, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſarie in regard it would ſerve for introduction of Poperie into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:111544:185"/>
               <p>This I find to be the <hi>Remora</hi> of my chief affaires with this State, my preſſing the reſtitution of the Townes in <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers</hi> being thought by many of theſe jealous people to hang on this thread, as a thing very acceptable, and agreeable at this time to the King of Spain, and much advantagious in this preſent conjuncture to his affaires; and my inſiſting upon ſending of Commiſſioners to his Majeſtie in the buſineſſe of our Merchants, they applie the ſame way, as if the opinion which would be conceived of this Embaſſage, (howſoever Merchants affaires were pretended, the chief intent was to play <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus in Comaedia</hi>) ſhould according to the uſe of <hi>Nitimur in Vetitum,</hi> rather kindle, then quench the deſire of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and draw the match to a more ſpeedie concluſion.</p>
               <p>At my laſt being with <hi>Mounſieur Barnevelt,</hi> I did expoſtulate the States delay of ſending Commiſſioners to his Majeſtie upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as neither anſwereth to Sir <hi>Noel Caron's</hi> word and promiſe to his Majeſtie, nor to that, which from his mouth, I did advertiſe your Lordſhip of the States inclination in general, and the reſolution in particular of thoſe of <hi>Holland.</hi> To which he anſwered me, That with much difficultie and oppoſition, he had obtained the aſſent of <hi>Holland,</hi> and that now the matter reſted with <hi>Zealand,</hi> but he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that his Majeſties reſtoring the old Company of Merchants, would make a ſtay of any farther proceeding, as now leſſe requiſite, howſoever, that Sir <hi>Noel Carone</hi> had advertiſed, that notwithſtanding this change, he thought the ſending of Commiſſioners very neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The Queſtions here about Religion, reſt in the ſame ſtate as I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed your Lordſhip in my laſt, the Aſſembly of <hi>Holland</hi> being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated untill the end of <hi>February ſtil. no.</hi> when they are to meet again. Mean while a proviſional order is taken, that the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> ſhall continue their preaching in our Engliſh Church, which they have accommodated with Scaffolds, to make it more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of their number.</p>
               <p>There was much queſtion in this Aſſemblie, whether his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhould be preſent, or no: but in the end he was called by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of voices, contrary to Mounſieur <hi>Barnevelt's</hi> opinion, and his authoritie over-ſwayed the matter in favour of the <hi>Contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi> for the continuance of their preaching, which it was propoſed to hinder by ſome violent Courſes.</p>
               <p>By example of this place, there is the like proviſional order taken for preaching at the <hi>Brill,</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and certain of the Burghers are eſtabliſhed in <hi>Tergow,</hi> who were put from their Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, for their expoſtulating with the Magiſtrate upon this quarrel.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:111544:186"/>
               <p>I have been ſpoken unto by divers particular perſons well affected in this cauſe, to procure a Letter from his Majeſtie to his Excellencie, whereby to comfort and encourage him in his Zeal for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the true doctrine, and the profeſſours thereof, againſt theſe Novelliſts and their opinions. Which I moſt humbly refer to his Majeſties wiſdom, (in caſe he judge this office neceſſarie) whether it be fit to be done by Letter or Meſſage, the former of which, will be of greater vertue, but the latter leſſe ſubject to croſſe conſtruction of the Arminian faction, which your Honour knowes how potent it is here amongſt thoſe who have chief rule in this State.

                  <salute>My moſt honourable Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IMmediately upon receipt of your Lordſhips Letter concerning Sir <hi>John Ogle,</hi> I moved the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> not onely for his leave for Sir <hi>John</hi> to go into <hi>England,</hi> but likewiſe for his Letters of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, whereby to give your Lordſhip ſubject, upon ſome ſuch teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his Excellencies good ſatisfaction, to ſet him upright in his Majeſties favour, both which he granted unto me: though againſt the firſt, he alledged the abſence of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonels; and touching the latter, he called to mind old matters; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (upon what I undertook for Sir <hi>John's</hi> future intentions) he was content to forget. I did once again upon Sir <hi>John's</hi> inſtance, put his Excellencie in mind of his diſpatch, wherein I found no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie. Since I find Sir <hi>John</hi> hath changed his purpoſe of going, and his excuſe will be made at his intreatie by his Excellencie, who hath ſince let me know, Though he would not deny me his leave, yet he is better content (in regard he is ſo ſlenderly accompanied with Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, in a time when the State hath need of their ſervice with his ſtay. So as Sir <hi>John</hi> hath the obligation to your Lordſhip of a favourable recommendation, and for his not prevailing himſelf of his leave when it was granted, I muſt leave to himſelf to render a reaſon. For my part,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:111544:186"/>having accompliſhed what I find by your Lordſhips Letter, to be agreeable both to his Majeſties pleaſure, &amp; your Lordſhips, I thought it my dutie to advertize. That there is an ancient difference between Sir <hi>Horacio Vere,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Cecyl,</hi> about the extent of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; whereupon followeth a great inconveniencie to the diſhonor of our Nation, (which as it appears when they were laſt in the field before <hi>Reez</hi>) are divided hereby, and march, and lodge in ſeveral bodies, and quarters. Much endeavour hath been formerly uſed in theſe parts to reconcile them, but all in vain, by reaſon of ſome ill Inſtruments, who wrought upon both their diſcontents to ſet them farther aſunder. Now, they are both in <hi>England,</hi> and are both writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for, to come over; It were a work worthy of your Lordſhip to make them underſtand one another better, and what they will not yeeld to of themſelves, to over-rule by his Majeſties authoritie. I may not conceal from your Lordſhip, that I am intreated by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himſelf to do this office, both with his Majeſtie, and your Lordſhip, wherein he would not be ſeen himſelf, becauſe having dealt between them fruitleſly heretofore, he doubteth of the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe now. But when their agreement ſhall be made, he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his obligation to your Lordſhip, and for the better proceeding therein, I ſent your Lordſhip a Copie of an order formerly ſet down betwixt them, with the tranſlate of Sir <hi>Horacio Vere's</hi> Commiſſion, (both which I had of his Excellencie) and likewiſe the beginning, and proceeding of their difference, as I have collected the ſame in brief out of other mens reports.</p>
               <p>The projects I ſent your Lordſhip with my laſt, of a <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Companie having been propoſed to the States of <hi>Guelderland</hi> for their ratification (who have the leading voice in the Aſſemblie of the States general, end were ever leaſt forward in that buſineſſe) hath thus far their allowance, that they will concur therein with the reſt of the Provinces. But withal I do underſtand, they have given their Deputies ſecret charge not to give way thereunto, in caſe they find it prejudicial to the Truce. Which makes the matter evident, that the project of the Company (though it be never ſo advanced) will ſtand or fall, according to the proceeding of the Truce. The expiration whereof approaching ſo neer, and here being advertiſements from <hi>Paris,</hi> that a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman one <hi>Belleavium</hi> (who was lately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed hither to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> about the difference betwixt him, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>) had ſecret inſtructions to ſound the States, how they ſtood affected to the renewing thereof. I have
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:111544:187"/>uſed all diligence to know how far he went; and am well informed, he hath done nothing therein of Conſideration: onely this paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and his Excellencie.</p>
               <p>He telling his Excellencie from <hi>Mounſieur Deſdiguieres,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Councel, how acceptable the extraordinarie Embaſſage intended from hence will be in that Court and thereupon perſwading a ſpeedie imbracing the opportunitie.</p>
               <p>From whence (ſaid his Excellencie after his round manner) cometh this alteration?</p>
               <p>To ſpeak plainly (ſaid he) they fear in <hi>France</hi> you will renew the Truce without them, and therefore by your Embaſſadours, they would interpoſe themſelves.</p>
               <p>Here are good advertiſements both from <hi>Bruxels</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intent is not to renew the Truce, but to have a Peace propoſed with theſe plauſible conditions; That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will pretend nothing in the Regiment of theſe United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, nor require any thing of them in the point of Religion, but leave all in terms as it now ſtands, with recognition onely of ſome titular Soveraigntie, which he cannot in honour relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh.</p>
               <p>This is already propoſed to <hi>France,</hi> as a glorious work to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a ſettled Peace in theſe parts of the world, but with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, That if it be not imbraced here, then <hi>France</hi> ſhall refuſe to give this State any further ſupport, or countenance, of which it is here believed, that <hi>Spain</hi> hath already obtained a firm promiſe in that Court. And that either the like overture is already made, or will be within few daies to his Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>Under which doth lie hidden many myſteries much to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and prejudice of this State: for the very propoſition of a new Treatie will diſtract them here very much, in regard of their unſettledneſſe, and aptneſſe upon any diſpute to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into faction, beſides many Conſiderations of importance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing properly to the Conſtitution of their Government, but the acceptation of the old, by renewing of the Truce upon the former terms, for ſo many years, more, or leſſe, as ſhall be thought fitting, will (in my poor opinion (which notwithſtanding is not ſlenderly grounded) take place, without much difficultie. The importance of this buſineſſe, hath made me give your Lordſhip this trouble, and your Lordſhip may be pleaſed to let his Majeſtie underſtand as well that little as is done by <hi>Mounſieur Belleavium,</hi> as what they here
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:111544:187"/>conceive to be further intended by the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> So I moſt humbly take leave, ever reſting</p>

               <p>NOt to give your Lordſhip the trouble of often Letters, I render an account of his Majeſties Commandments by the ſame hand I uſually receive them. One I had lately by an expreſſe Letter from his Majeſtie, accompanied with another from your Lordſhip, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Lord of <hi>Buckleugh,</hi> to demand full ſatisfaction of the States, for all his Lordſhips pretentions, and to that effect to procure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Commiſſion to be ſent to Sir <hi>Noel Carone</hi> to end this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>To which effect I have moved both his Excellencie and the States, and whileſt they were treating thereof, Colonel <hi>Brogue</hi> arrived here out of Scotland: with whom they are now handling to put him to Penſion, and to give my Lord the Command of his Regiment in lieu of his Pretenſions. Which when they come to calculate, my Lord will find a ſhort reckoning of them, and to ſend accounts out of their accountants hands, and refer them to others, they will never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if the courſe they now take can be gone thorough with (which Colonel <hi>Brogue</hi> doth moſt unwillingly hear of) it will be then in my Lords choice, whether he will remain ſatisfied, or not. And within few daies I hope to return my Lords Secretarie with advertiſement of what is done.

               <p>In the preſent condition of publique affaires, your Lordſhip know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well how at this inſtant we have all <hi>buone Parolle</hi> out of Spain, and <hi>Cattivi-fatti</hi> of all the reſt of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> In ſo much as theſe Low-Countrie Troops under the governance of the Infanta, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the blocking up of a poor town, all which remaines of his

And what place in the world to which they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from hence (and is eaſily gueſſed in all their extreamitie, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will be forced to flie) is not ſubject to the ſame quarrel? within this week that I now write (betwixt Sunday, and Sunday) we were here in that ſtate, if God had not prevented it, this Countrie had been too hot for them to remain in, and it had been a happineſſe for them, if they could have got a poore skeveling boat to have tranſported them elſe-where. This Bearer my Nephew will inform your Lordſhip more particularly thereof.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>de agendis,</hi> there reſts no more, then queſtion of maintaining the Army of <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> and <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> which is lodged at the preſent in a place, out of which, it can hardly match, and more hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. If it have pay, and countenance, it may do good ſervice in <hi>Germany;</hi> if not, I will tell your Lordſhip what I conceive may be the conſequence. It will be hedged into <hi>East-Friſeland</hi> by <hi>Tillie,</hi> (whoſe Troops alreadie draw that way) <hi>Cordova</hi> and <hi>Anholt,</hi> againſt which keeping it ſelf within that Countrie, it will be able to make reſiſtance, as the poore Peaſants thereof did heretofore againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, by reaſon of the difficultie of acceſſe. From this State it will have all aſſiſtance, and though it be kept in by land, it will have the Sea open betwixt <hi>Griett</hi> and <hi>Norden,</hi> (both which places are in <hi>Manſ-felts</hi> poſſeſſion) a <hi>Haven</hi> fit for a Fleet of <hi>Gallions.</hi> If by that meanes they, with correſpondencie with this State may ſupport themſelves, it will be very ill for many important conſequences. If they and this State, (which will be forced to run a fortune together) be overcome, much worſe; for what can keep the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> from ſubjection to the <hi>Auſtriaci?</hi> Wee ſee how in <hi>Terra firma,</hi> the <hi>Walloons</hi> joyned to <hi>Spaniards,</hi> both make and maintain their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. Joyn the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to them by Sea, they will reap the like ſervice by them. The fruit we have reaped heretofore of the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Provinces, both for defence in the year 88. and offence in the <hi>Cadiz</hi> journey, ſheweth what a ſtrong addition this is to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power.</p>
               <p>My moſt honourable Lord, I am ſo full of ſuch like ſpeculations, that theſe have broken out <hi>ex Plentitudine Cordis,</hi> ſurcharged with grief to ſee in <hi>Plenitudine temporis,</hi> that to come to effect in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

               <p>I Obſerve in ſuch Letters from the Prince Electour to her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with the ſight of which, ſhe is pleaſed ſometimes to favour me, a miſ-underſtanding betwixt him, and his Uncle the Duke of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon,</hi> who groweth wearie of his Gueſt, doubting leaſt in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſome danger may be drawn upon his Town of <hi>Sedan;</hi> And the jealouſie the Prince conceiveth, what may be done with him in caſe of a Siege; (againſt which, that is no place to make long reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) beſides the diſcomforts of living in another mans houſe, and being ill looked on, makes him wiſh himſelf any where elſe; but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here, where he is as much deſired, as miſſed by her Highneſſe, his children, and Familie: And where the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the States (apprehending very well his preſent danger, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie) will give him very willingly his wonted welcome. Your Lordſhip may be pleaſed to make thus much known to his Majeſtie: And if your Lordſhip can ſo diſpoſe of the matter, that with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties good liking, he may return hither again, I know nothing your Lordſhip can do more agreeable to her Highneſſe, though ſhe doth whollie ſubmit her affections and deſires to his Majeſties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>The wars were never warmer then they are alreadie, and now like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more to kindle in theſe parts: The Siege of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> by thoſe which were preſent there and are now in <hi>Berghem,</hi> being
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:111544:189"/>eſteemed ſport in compariſon of the furie is uſed in diſputing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of that Town. Where on Munday laſt in the night an aſſault was given, and maintained ſix hours by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon a half Moon kept by the Dutch on the North ſide; out of which they were three ſeveral times repulſed, with the loſſe of betwixt 3. and 400 men of their beſt, and on this ſide under 40. All that they gained being (after the ſame manner as their former attempt on the other ſide wherein Colonel <hi>Hynderſon</hi> was ſlain) to lodge in the foot of the work. Two of our old Captaines, Sir <hi>Michael Everard,</hi> and <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> (hurt in that, and the like aſſault given on that ſide within few daies after) are both dead of their wounds within theſe two daies. One at <hi>Dort,</hi> the other at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> whither they were retired to be cured: which is imputed by the Chyrurgeons to ſome malignity is uſed to the bullets: but that is not to be believed amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet I have ſeen ſome brought hither ſhot by the Enemie, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to break all quarter.</p>
               <p>We ſhall have now queſtionleſſe many and ſharp encounters in the field; Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> being on his way hitherwards with his Armie, much weakned during his abode in the Frontiers of <hi>France;</hi> but of ſtrength ſufficient to march through the open Countries of <hi>Henault,</hi> and <hi>Brabant.</hi> Which courſe he takes directly with intention to come to <hi>Breda.</hi> And where by computation, he ſhould be by Munday, or Teuſday next at the fartheſt, unleſſe he be overtaken by <hi>Don Conzales de Cordova,</hi> or met with by the Count <hi>Henric Vandenbergh,</hi> or the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <hi>Spinola,</hi> in any of which there is ſmall appearance. <hi>Cordova</hi> going forward at leiſure with 16. peices of Canon, and the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this preſent, when <hi>Mansfelt</hi> paſſed a bridge at <hi>Marpent</hi> over the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi> in <hi>Henault</hi> (which was the onely paſſage of difficultie, and that as our advertiſements here ſay, he croſſed without reſiſtance) being ſome hours March behind him, who having three field pieces onely, and ſmall ſtore of baggage, and in effect his whole Armie on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, may make great expedition.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Vandenbergh</hi> ſtir, he will be followed by the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> And the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> cannot go ſtrong enough to incounter him without raiſing his Siege at <hi>Berghen,</hi> which though he ſhould do, the <hi>Campaigne</hi> is large enough, and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> lightly laden to take, and leave at pleaſure, it being in his power, (if his way to <hi>Brdea</hi> be ſtopped) to fall down towards ſuch places, the State hold in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The States furniſh him with 6000 <hi>Florins</hi> for the time of three moneths, they entertain him and his Army. In which ſpace, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:111544:189"/>they hope to draw from him, is, the raiſing the Siege of <hi>Berghen,</hi> by cutting off the Convoyes betwixt <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and the Spaniſh Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer, which can no longer continue in the place it now remains, then it can keep the way of <hi>Antwerp</hi> open, by which only their victuals and Munition is conducted.</p>
               <p>This time of three moneths expired, there is ſmall appearance of longer entertainment of <hi>Mansfelt</hi> by this State, who doth then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to retire to the Duke <hi>Chriſtien</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick's</hi> old Quarter at <hi>Lipſtadt:</hi> Where they intend to winter their Army, and augment the ſame againſt the next Spring, to return again into <hi>Germany,</hi> if the Peace of thoſe parts be not concluded, or ſome miſchance do not happen in the mean time. Which reſolution of theirs, for ſuch it is (as I am very well informed) deſerves the more to be cheriſhed, by how much the more diſreſpect is ſhewed his Majeſties Embaſſadour in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> by burning and ſpoyling her Highneſſe Joynture even in his view, (as <hi>Don Gonzales</hi> did whileſt he remained in thoſe parts) and ſince beſieging his Majeſties Garriſon <hi>Heidelbergh;</hi> before which place, we underſtand here by Letters of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. from <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that Baron <hi>Tillie</hi> began his approaches the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>I have not heard what is the iſſue of Captain <hi>Brett's</hi> buſineſſe, but hope the beſt. Colonel <hi>Hynderſon's</hi> Regiment was given upon the firſt newes of his death to Sir <hi>Francis Hynderſon</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with which the States are much diſpleaſed, as contrarying their Act. And I have lamented my ſelf to them, as a wrong done my Lord of <hi>Buckleugh,</hi> and his Majeſtie, in his behalf: which they promiſe me to repair, as they poſſibly may be able. And I preſſe them to it by thoſe means which your Lordſhip will find contained in an abſtract of a Letter I wrote lately to his Excellencie, chiefly to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Her Highneſſe having received a fair Preſent from the Prince her Brother, doth render his Highneſſe thanks by the incloſed. I know not ſo great a Ladie in the world, nor ever did, (though I have ſeen many Courts) of ſuch natural affections: An obedient Daughter; A loving Siſter; And a tender Wife, whoſe care of her Husband doth augment with his misfortunes.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip cannot therefore ſhew your care of her more, then by bringing them again together with the ſooneſt. Of which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Lordſhip, that with the ſooneſt I may know what hope there is, and that (if your Lordſhip pleaſe) by Mr. <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi>

               <p>THe general knowledge the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> received from your Grace, by my Nephew, of the diſpoſition of our affairs at home, ſince his Highneſſe, and your Graces return out of <hi>Spain,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true underſtanding you have bred in his Majeſtie of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh proceedings, being more particularly both for the ſtate of the matter, and the manner fit to be held here in diſpoſing theſe men to ſuch overtures as are neceſſarie, expreſſed unto me by Sir <hi>George Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> with ſpecial caution of ſecreſie and celeritie.</p>
               <p>I have thought fit to ſet down at large (whileſt it is freſh in my memorie) an opportunitie as properly given unto me this day by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who is the onely perſon of power and confidence we have here to treat withal) as I hope your Grace will judge it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably taken.</p>
               <p>And that was an occaſion of buſineſſe concerning a mutinie at <hi>Breda,</hi> which drew the Councel of State, (where I have my Seance) to the States general, with whom we found the Prince. That buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ending in good time, gave him a long hours leiſure with me afterwards in his Garden, which he himſelf deſired of me, becauſe ſomewhat was farther to be digeſted betwixt us concerning the Engliſh Troops, which ſhewed themſelves moſt in this Mutinie: And hereupon the conſideration of the neceſſity of this State, and impoſſibility of giving their Troops full contentment, gave us ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of further diſcourſe, both of the means of better payment they have here at home, and the helps they might conceive from abroad,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:111544:190"/>which making appear unto me to be coldeſt from <hi>England,</hi> as long as our Match with Spain is ſtill in treatie, he asked me bluntly (after his manner), <hi>Qui at'il de voſtre Mariage?</hi> I told him, it was now at a ſtay upon this point, That the reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> muſt be firſt concluded. And that the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was not onely well comforted with this aſſurance, but pleaſed her ſelf with a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, that the opportunity was never fairer for this State to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the King her Fathers favour, and return to the antient ſupport of his Crownes, which by the way of gratitude for her good uſage, ſince ſhe had her refuge into theſe parts, ſhe could not but admoniſh his Excellencie of, and adviſe him not to let it ſlip. This he did not ſo ſuddenly lay hold of, as not firſt to caſt many miſdoubts, as if the alienation were too great, and his Majeſtie too much wedded in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, if not in Alliance to new friends, to be ſo ſoone reconjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his old, as their neceſſities did require.</p>
               <p>Here I took occaſion to play my own Part, and to remember unto him how things had paſſed within the compaſſe of my experience from the beginning; letting him know what friendſhip his Majeſtie had ſhewed this State, in the making their <hi>Truce;</hi> what ſinceritie in rendring their Cautionarie Townes according to contract, when they were demanded; what affection in ſupporting their affaires during their late domeſtique diſputes; what care in ſettling our <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> differences: finallie, what Patience in conniving at all the miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and inſolencies of their Sea-men, without ſeeking revenge.</p>
               <p>And hereupon concluded, that I found them here in the ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as men are, which put firſt from Land to Sea, and believe the Land paſſes from them, not they from the Land, in that the Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath long been nouriſhed betwixt his Majeſtie and this State, ſprang originally from them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by <hi>Barnevelt</hi> and his faction of Arminians carrying the State to new Alliances, with the Hans-Townes, and otherwiſe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, refuſing ſo much as the knowledge of them to my Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour in this place, Sir <hi>Ralph Wynwood,</hi> with much ſcorn, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>Next, by a harſh and peremptorie ſtile, uſed in all we had then to do with them, ſavouring rather of Pride and preſumption, then any due reſpect or deſire of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by a precipitate courſe taken at Sea by their ſhips of war and Merchants againſt his Majeſties Subjects, making prize of ſome, ſhouldering others out of their places of trade, and entring in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> into open hoſtilitie, avowed by a publique Act of the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:111544:191"/>States General. This ill courſe begun and purſued for ſome yeares continuance, breeding a deſerved diſtaſte in his Majeſtie on this ſide; and on the Spaniſh part fair overtures of friendſhip, being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie made, and confirmed by the tender of a Match of a potent Prince, None can marvel that his Majeſtie did imbrace the ſame, unleſſe it ſhould be expected of him, that for love of this State how ill ſoever deſerving, he ſhould lend a deaf eare to all other friendſhips, that did not concurre with the intereſt of this State. And the remembrance of theſe things not being ſo old as to be worn out, they might here very well conceive, that the ſuſpition of Alienation and diſaffection, is as ſtrong on our ſide for their giving the cauſe of our leaning another way, as on theirs for the effect which hath ſince followed. And now the cauſe is removed, the effect may poſſibly ceaſe in like manner, if we may have good aſſurance, that breaking with our new friends upon the occaſions now preſented, we might faſten after the wonted manner with an old: and the King be ſatisfied in ſuch doubts, he may upon good reaſon caſt, and know certainly what to truſt to. To this concluſion he anſwered (confeſſing firſt their many obligations to his Majeſtie, both for his favour, and ſufferance,) that nothing could be more certain, then the affection of this State to a Prince embracing their cauſe of oppoſition to Spain. And if his Majeſtie could take that reſolution, he might diſpoſe of them, their lives and their fortunes. I told him, that more (in a caſe of this importance, when there was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of alteration of the whole courſe of a great Princes affaires) would be required then bare profeſſions and proteſtations, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he knew I was not ignorant, how many Billets, and Papers have been heretofore brought hither by
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>An old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of this towne, who by paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port on both ſides trots ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to and fro betwixt this and</hi> Bruxells, <hi>(where ſhe hath private acceſſe to the Infanta) that ſhe is known by the title of</hi> la Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querelle de la Trefue.</note> Madam <hi>Serclaus,</hi> and others, tending to <hi>Truce,</hi> or peace, and how much ſuch a matter was thirſted after by their Frontier Provinces, which being free for them to take, or leave, after their own humours, it was not likely his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie would diſcharge them of their burthen, to pull it upon his own Shoulders; But to enter into the common cauſe of defence, and add a powerful hand in ſupporting them, might be faiſable, in the preſent conjuncture, upon good aſſurance, he ſhould never be left ſingle in the quarrel. Whereunto he anſwered, that true it was, the woman I named, and divers others, had been tampering heretofore about ſuch Treaties, &amp; that he had continually put their Papers into his Pocket, and ſo ſuppreſſed (them with conſent of ſome of the States, of whom he was moſt confident) leſt ſuch propoſitions, being brought into their publique Aſſemblies, might have driven them into diſtraction,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:111544:191"/>and diſpute one with another according to their ſeveral affections, either to Peace, or War, and thereby ſlacken their Contributions, wherewith they pay their Army, and by conſequence expoſe them to the mercie of the enemy.</p>
               <p>And that this courſe of his being finally diſcovered by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <hi>Spinola,</hi> and <hi>Peckius,</hi> their purpoſe now was (as he is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately advertized from <hi>Bruxels</hi>) to ſteal over ſome perſon hither by the uſual meanes of Paſſe-ports for Merchants and Travailers, to make ſome ſuch like Propoſition at the ſeveral Aſſemblies of the States of theſe united Provinces: which it ſhould be his ſtudie to prevent, becauſe of the miſchief may be bred thereby amongſt them; And this he aſſured me for concluſion, That as their affections and affairs now ſtand, nothing but deſpair can bring theſe Provinces to Peace, or Truce with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I yielded, but ſaid, That was not enough becauſe of ſuch changes, to which the world was daily ſubject. Neither did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> undertake their protection upon ſuch bare preſumptions, wherefore ſome further aſſurance muſt be thought on; which he conſented unto, as a thing requiſite on both ſides, and joyned iſſue with me in this point, That when the King would be to this State, as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was; this State would be to him, as it was to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being <hi>opus unius diei,</hi> not unlike the firſt day of the Creation of the world in diſtinguiſhing light and darkneſſe, I will give your Grace this further light, of what belongs to negotiation with this State.</p>
               <p>The preſent opportunitie of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> good affection and ſtrength of theſe Provinces both by Sea and Land, as it yet ſtands, (but not poſſible ſo long to continue) being ſeaſonably laid hold of, his Majeſtie may have with this State a firm and fruitful alliance.</p>
               <p>But if the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhould die, (as he is much broken, and the laſt year at this time, we did not think he could live till <hi>May</hi>) or the enemy break into the borders of this State, (as this laſt Summer, if the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had joyned with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they had undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly done; and unleſſe ſome Change or Alteration happen, as is feared will do this next year) the beſt link we have for a bond of friendſhip would fail, and as much difference be betwixt this State, as it now is, and what it is like to be upon any ſuch ill accident, (as
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:111544:192"/>was now feared, and ſtill hangs over them) as betwixt a ſtrong Staffe, and a broken Reed. So I ceaſe to give your Grace any further trouble.</p>

               <p>VVHat Comfort and Contentment the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in your Graces Meſſage and Letter by my Nephew, I leave to her own expreſſion, which never failes her, when her heart goeth with her hand, as I can aſſure your Grace, it doth in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And this I will ſay more, who can ſay nothing but truth, I never knew your Grace ill with this good and gracious Princeſſe; but now you are ſo well ſettled in her good opinion and favour, that I know none hath more intereſt therein.</p>
               <p>And this uſe your Grace may make thereof to his Majeſties ſervice, that now this King and Queen are both of them no leſſe confident of your affection, then they are of your ſinceritie; what you adviſe them in their affairs will be of much weight to ſway them in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of their judgment.</p>
               <p>Which now a Propoſition is made unto them, on which their whole eſtate doth depend as well for themſelves, as their poſteritie, full of doubtful circumſtances on both ſides, (the choice not being, as they conceive, betwixt one thing certain, and another uncertain; but betwixt two unequal uncertainties) it is hard to ſay which way they incline: but if they be left to themſelves, I perceive they will rather ſtand to the hazard of the latter, with preſervation of their honour and lawful pretenſions, then ſubmit themſelves to the former with ſhame and diſgrace, and no aſſurance of better dealing then was uſed to the deported Houſe of <hi>Saxe,</hi> by a better Emperour then
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:111544:192"/>this accounted, of which we have the Heir (one of the worthieſt Princes in <hi>Germanie</hi>) here in hard Conditions amongſt us. And he ſerves as a ſpectacle to theſe Princes of their fortunes by the ſame way as his Predeceſſors took, of ſubmiſſion. Yet other things being before agreed of, and ſettled in that ſort as his Majeſtie hath alwaies aſſured theſe Princes to be his full intention of reſtitution to their Patrimonial Honours and eſtate; This King I find will conform himſelf, to what his Majeſtie ſhall think fit, touching a due ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>But this being a matter of ceremony, the other of ſubſtance, he judgeth, that if this precede, (that is, the Submiſſion) the other of reſtitution will never follow. Neither can it be well ſeen, how in poſſibility it may be effected, conſidering that (whileſt things have been held ſometimes in terms, alwaies in talk of accommodation) the Electoral is given to <hi>Bavier</hi> by the Emperour, and avowed by a Congratulatory Embaſſage from <hi>Bruxels:</hi> the upper <hi>Palatinate</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his poſſeſſion, with ſome portion to <hi>Newburgh</hi> for his Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ingagement. A principal part of the lower <hi>Palatinate</hi> (the <hi>Bergſtrate</hi>) given to the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> with the conſent of thoſe of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> (where he was lately in perſon to obtain it) though they groſſely diſſemble it, and promiſes of parts of the reſt made to other Princes.</p>
               <p>So as what is now pretended (I muſt deal plainly with your Grace) is no otherwaies interpreted, then as experience doth teach of theſe three former years proceedings: Ever new Overtures in Winter, and new Ruptures in the Summer. And as of two former Treaties with this Prince, which paſſed my hands, (one a Conſent to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſent to <hi>Vienna,</hi> the other a Ratification of a Suſpenſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſent to <hi>Bruxels</hi>) no other uſe was made, but with the firſt to accelerate <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> in his Treatie of Peace with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as then on foot, and with the ſecond to intimidate both the Electours <hi>Saxe,</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> with the Princes of the <hi>Nethes, Saxe,</hi> and <hi>Creyes</hi> from entring into Armes, to which they were well diſpoſed, upon the diſcontentment they received of the prepoſterous courſes that were taken in the Diet at <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> (and to this effect Copies of the very projects of the ſaid Treaties were diſperſed by the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> before the Inſtruments themſelves were perfected,) ſo it is here believed, that now <hi>Gabor</hi> is again in armes, and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ready to imbrace any good occaſion of redreſſe of affaires, time is onely ſought to be gained by this new Overture, and the King of <hi>Bohemia's</hi> Credit, with his friends and well wiſhers in <hi>Germanie</hi> to be
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:111544:193"/>weakned, if not loſt; for if once he ſubmit himſelf allowing the tranſlation of the Electoral, he ſhall thereby avow the Emperours undue procedings in that cauſe (which have been proteſted againſt by <hi>Saxe,</hi> and <hi>Brandenbergh,</hi> and all the other <hi>Germane</hi> Princes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe onely of the Catholique league) and by whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon any ill dealing can he expect to be befriended, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes himſelf and his own cauſe? This is the diſcourſe of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon this occaſion; but when they are asked, What then can you truſt unto? their recourſe is to his Majeſtie, who they hope know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the meanes to effect in their behalf, what he hath ſo long, and ſo conſtantly undertaken for them. And though for theſe three or four years paſt, affaires on this ſide have gone in a continual deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and now threaten a final ruine, unleſſe it be withſtood by ſome Princelie Reſolution; (not of pettie, but of great Princes) yet here is no ſuch diſcouragement: but that it is thought there is yet ſtrength and vigour enough left in the good Party, not onely to ſubſiſt, but to riſe and flouriſh again as well as ever. And in this cogitation the King and Queen remain, not preſcribing any thing to his Majeſtie, nor willing to ſubmit themſelves anew to the ſame rod, with which they have been ſo often ſcourged.</p>
               <p>Your Grace was lately invited with my Lord of <hi>Richmond</hi> to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten their young Son, which being excuſed by my Lord of <hi>Richmond</hi> in both your names, And the King of <hi>France</hi> undertaking that office, it was performed by that King, and the King of <hi>Swede</hi> yeſterday was ſeven-night (repreſented by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour here reſident, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>) in the ſame manner, and the ſame Church, as the Princeſſe <hi>Louiſe,</hi> bearing the ſame name, was chriſtned the laſt year: when the Duke <hi>Chriſtien</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> being invited to be Godfather, though abſent, and for ſome reſpects of precedence could not have a Deputie, was underſtood notwithſtanding to be one of the <hi>Parrins;</hi> and ſo do the King and Queen hold both your Grace, and my Lord of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt now render your Grace my humble thanks for your mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of your favour to my ſelf, which you are pleaſed to do in ſuch ample manner, as to tell me farther for my Comfort who are my friends; And a farther effect of friendſhip, I could not expect of them, then to procure me the aſſurance I now receive from your Grace, who have won the reputation by your Conſtancie to thoſe you take into your Care, that your word is taken for your deed. And though that, which I thought fitteſt for my ſelf failes me, if your Grace can think me fit for any thing elſe towards the amendment of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:111544:193"/>my poor fortune, I ſhall attend the ſame with much patience of mind, though great extreamitie otherwiſe, by reaſon of a ſmall eſtate charged with great debts, (which are no ſmall burthen to an honeſt mind,) And ever remain</p>

               <p>THe Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> deſirous to draw the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to more then general profeſſions of ſervice to his Majeſtie, hath ſometimes in my preſence, when I waited on her highneſſe, given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſcourſe her ſelf, and at other times I have ſpoken in her name with his Excellencie to the like effect, as in my former Letter to your Grace: which cauſed his Excellencie to take three of the States, ſuch of whom he is moſt confident (one of <hi>Guelderland,</hi> another of <hi>Holland,</hi> the third of <hi>Zealand</hi>) unto him, to ſtrengthen himſelf by their concurrence in that, which is his own inclination, of carrying this State to a ſtrict alliance with his Majeſtie, in which he told them, That firſt their minds muſt be known, and next ſuch aſſurance thought of, as not onely muſt give his Majeſtie preſent Contentment, but likewiſe free him from all miſdoubt for the future, that either upon offers from <hi>Spain</hi> to theſe Provinces, or any ſiniſter accidents of War, they ſhould be induced to make Peace or Truce without his Majeſties conſent.</p>
               <p>Whereunto they anſwered him, (as I have it from himſelf this day) That nothing could be more agreeable to their affections, and Intereſts in all reſpects, then to be under his Majeſties protection: And for aſſurance of their remaining conſtant to that courſe, they doubted not, but when the matter ſhould be treated of, the Provinces would willingly condeſcend to what ſhould be neceſſary to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie in relation hereof unto me went ſo much further, as to inſtance in their new reſolution here, now finally put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:111544:194"/>of making Voyages into the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> after the ſame form, as they have done into the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> both which joyned together, make them irreconcileable with Spain. Yet if his Majeſtie will have a further tye on them, they will not refuſe it; but he ſaith, The States will expect that ſuch obligation be mutual, and that they in like manner may reſt aſſured, when they put themſelves wholly under his Majeſties wings, his Majeſtie will not flie from them, and make his peace without them.</p>
               <p>I told him the caſe was not equal betwixt his Majeſtie, and them, they being actually in War, his Majeſtie in Peace: ſo as to come to a conjunction, his Majeſtie muſt change condition, not they, and therefore hath the more reaſon to look before he leap out of Peace into War. And ſo did Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who had raigned 27 years before ſhe openly took upon her the protection of theſe Countries; but after continued her War in their Cauſe to her dying day. This he confeſſed, but remembred withal, That there was a Treatie of <hi>Burburck,</hi> with which the States were much ſtartled, and he thought that when this buſineſſe ſhould be more particularly ſcanned amongſt them, as they would willingly give, ſo they would expect to receive good aſſurance.</p>
               <p>In this point of declaration of their affection, and willingneſſe to warrant his Majeſtie ſufficiently, I asked him, How far I might go not to be diſavowed: ſo as if his Majeſtie ſhould take any ſuddain reſolution, according as affaires require, he might confidently build upon the concurrence of this State. He anſwered me, That a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this kind would require a further proceeding, then was fit, untill his Majeſtie would be content to make his mind known, by ſuch private means as might ſeem beſt to his own wiſdom, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own liking, they would inlarge this matter here, to more mens knowledge, then the ſmall circle, in which it hitherto walked, and guide it in that manner as may be fit for the form of it to his Majeſties honour, and for the ſubſtance to his full contentment. Which he offered to do now if I would preſſe him to it; but withal told me his opinion, that it would raiſe nothing but bruit and noiſe without effect, when we had here no better ground to work upon, and therefore wiſhed the buſineſſe might expect a return from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, if he could be content it ſhould be proceeded in. In theſe terms remains this buſineſſe, not free from many Cautions, and nice Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; and yet on this ſide, (I can aſſure your Grace) full of good affection; but theſe are the true reaſons of their coming on no faſter. They hold it for a maxime, That <hi>Spain</hi> will never match with
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:111544:194"/>his Majeſtie for love, but either for hope, or fear. If <hi>Spain</hi> can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope of reducing theſe Provinces to obedience by the Match, or fear, that unleſſe the Match proceed, his Majeſtie will joyn with theſe Provinces in oppoſition to Spain: They hold in either of theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Match as made. And therefore leſt ſome uſe ſhould be made of their preſentations of themſelves, to their own prejudice, they are thus ſhie, and circumſpect. Beſides, as they have had ſome help of money out of <hi>France</hi> this laſt year, ſo they are entertained with hopes of more againſt the next: which they fear would be excuſed upon any offer they ſhould make of themſelves towards his Majeſtie, and therefore are loath to adventure the exchange of a ſubſtance, for that which appears unto them hitherto, no better then a ſhadow; And they are indeed very umbragious; for they ſuſpect, that Tentatives of this kind, of which ſome have been made heretofore amongſt them, tend to no other end, then to endear our Merchandize with <hi>Spain,</hi> and let the Miniſters of that Crown know, that we refuſe in their Contemplation. But when his Majeſtie ſhall reſolve in his own heart, and be pleaſed to make himſelf ſo underſtood, it will be no hard matter by his Excellencies means (who is a Prince full of good intentions and real affections to his Majeſtie, and his royal Family) to make theſe men lay by their Jealouſies, and be as true to his Majeſtie, and the ſupport of his Crowns, as his own Kingdomes. Which is no more then they owe for the protection which theſe that are now in Government had of his Majeſtie, when they were lately ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen of a contrary faction; and no more then upon a good knowledge of their Intereſts and affections I can undertake for them, they will really and readily pay, if the matter be well managed. In which the confidence and freedom I have uſed with this Noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Sir <hi>George Goring,</hi> may give your Grace ſome further light, as any doubts ſhall ariſe concerning the buſineſſe.

               <p>THe buſineſſe of ſtrict conjunction betwixt his Majeſtie, and this State (touching which the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath received his Highneſſe, and your Graces Letters, and I your Graces of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this preſent) goeth on the right foot (according as your Grace will ſee more particularly by my Letters to Mr. Secretarie <hi>Conway,</hi> and as the matter is here imbraced with much affection, ſo for the manner I doubt not but it will be well ordered in that ſort, as will be for his Majeſties honour, and contentment. But in regard of jealouſies towards us, and emulations amongſt theſe men in matters of imployment, (to which all men are ſubject, eſpecially in good and advantagious buſineſſes, ſome time, will be required, to ſet all in the right way, yet no illimited time; for I hope within a week all will be reſolved of, and within a a few dayes more, put in execution fullie to expectation. Sir <hi>Noel Caron</hi> writes, a league offenſive and defenſive will be imbraced by his Majeſtie, if it be propoſed from hence, with offer of aſſurance; And I aſſure my ſelf both the overture, and offer will be made and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie effected, if it be anſwered on our ſide with good correſpondence. That which buſieth my cogitations is, that <hi>tempus agendi</hi> may be loſt <hi>Conſultando;</hi> and therefore ſeeing how both his Majeſtie, and this State ſtand affected, I will take the libertie to give your Grace two advertiſements in matters of action, which will be of exceeding fruit, if they be thought of in time, and for which there is no time to ſpare.</p>
               <p>One is, that your Grace doth inquire after in your Letter to the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (who excuſeth writing either to his Highneſſe, or your Grace till the States have reſolved of their ſending) that is the States preparation for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> which way, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie for thoſe parts newlie erected in theſe, hath ſet out one Fleet of 32. Sayl now alreadie at Sea, with ſome Land men amongſt them, to put on ground and fortifie as they ſhall find occaſion; for which they have men for the purpoſe, and all materials readie embarqued with them.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Fleet they are now preparing againſt April next, about which all their Admiralties and ſome of the Deputies of this new <hi>West-Indian</hi> Companie are here at this preſent. And the deſign is, for the Admiralties to ſet out at the charge of the generalitie twelve good ſhips of war, beſides they have alreadie on the coaſt of Spain and in the narrow Seas, which they will ſtill continue.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:111544:195"/>
               <p>To theſe 12. ſhips they require the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Companie to joyn 12. more, which will make a good Fleet, and this they intend ſhall be readie (as I ſayd) in April next, to attend the coming of the Spaniſh <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Fleet, which here they underſtand is put into the <hi>Havana,</hi> with intention there to winter as it did the laſt year.</p>
               <p>Now if his Majeſtie will give leave to his ſubjects to erect a Companie for the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and joyn with theſe men in thoſe Parts, as they do in the Eaſt, (and upon more equal conditions, ſince the buſineſſe is but now in the beginning) it will be here gladlie imbraced. And if he will frame a Fleet betwixt his own ſhips and his Merchants to joyn with the States Fleet prepared for April next to intercept the Spaniſh <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Fleet, nothing more will be deſired by theſe men, and there is nothing of which for the preſent they promiſe themſelves greater fruit: for either they hope to take, or to ſtop the ſilver of thoſe parts (both which are good ſervices, conſidering the need of mony, the Spaniards have in theſe), or elſe they reſolve with the ſhips which belong to the companie to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their voyage of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is a Truce with the <hi>Pyrates</hi> of <hi>Algier,</hi> ſuch an one as this State hath made in conformitie to their peace with the Grand Seigniour, which will be no more obſerved for unmoleſting all, and every one of our Merchants ſhips as they are ſtraglingly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, then it is with theſe men, who ſuffer many loſſes in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but thoſe are recompenſed in the General. For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are much amazed with this correſpondence; And the men of War of this State, or ſuch Merchants, as can make any reaſonable defence are moſt medled withal. Beſides, in any matter of offence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur together; And even now a propoſition is made from <hi>Algier</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (which I have from his own mouth to acquaint your Grace therewith) that in caſe this State againſt the beginning of next ſommer will ſet out twenty Sayl of ſhips upon any good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice againſt the Spaniards, they will joyn unto them 60. Sayl to purſue the deſign, whatſoever it ſhall be of this State. The accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which offer being now in deliberation, it will be ſuſpended till it be ſeen, how this unexpected buſineſſe with his Majeſtie may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; And then they will here do nothing but that, as may concur with our common Intereſts. But becauſe the negotiation of this matter with thoſe of <hi>Algier</hi> (that is a Truce betwixt his Majeſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and thoſe men) will require time, your Grace may proviſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie move his Majeſtie (if the matter be well liked) to uſe ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:111544:196"/>as may conduce thereunto. Here they uſe to write, and ſend through <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to the Conſul they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie at <hi>Algeir,</hi> by whoſe meanes (if no better preſent it ſelf) any thing may be propoſed, his Majeſty ſhall find fitting.</p>
               <p>Other things, I will within few daies remonſtrate to your Grace for his Majeſties ſervice in this change of affaires, which require all poſſible induſtries, and diligences to be uſed both far and neer; And thoſe not neglected, I doubt not, but they who have ſo groſſely abuſed his Majeſties friendſhip, will ſoone repent themſelves, and by their harmes ſee their own errours.

The Perſons are <hi>Aerſons</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Joachim</hi> of <hi>Zealand,</hi> both able, and well affected Perſons, and both ſufficiently known to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie by former imployments.

Which after more debates, and diſtaſts, then have paſſed with all the world beſides.

               <p>IT were a ſin againſt the publique ſervice, in which your Grace doth imploy your ſelf ſo much to the common good, and your own honour, to moleſt you with Letters in this buſie time: which muſt ſerve me for excuſe of ſilence, ſince the beginning of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. What I write now is by Commandment of the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> concerning this Bearer Captain <hi>Gifford</hi> an old Seaman of our Nation, who having a private ſuite to the States, hath made a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney over hither with recommendation to me from our two Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for advancement thereof, but with a further purpoſe to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Queen againſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in a matter of no leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then taking of a Gallion, which uſually bringeth the treaſure over the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> from <hi>Nova Spagna</hi> to the <hi>Havana.</hi> Which he deſigns after this manner: To go out with two Ships and a Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:111544:197"/>onely fitted for fight, without more in number, becauſe of the Alarum would be taken at a greater Fleet, and to lie under Covert of a ſmall Iſland in the entrie of the Gulph of <hi>Mexico:</hi> where the Gallion coming uſually alone, unleſſe it be accompanied with ſome Merchants ſhips, which he ſets light by, and which incumbred with goods and Paſſengers, he think may be maſtered, and taken, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſecuritie in which that Gallion, with the reſt of that <hi>Nova Spagna</hi> Fleet, do ſayl ſcattering in the <hi>Gulph,</hi> till they meet with the Fleet of <hi>Terra Firma</hi> at the <hi>Havana,</hi> where he having been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fore a priſoner made this obſervation, and doth now offer himſelf to put the deſign in execution, with a demand of betwixt 10000 and a 11000 <abbr>l.</abbr> for the whole equipage.</p>
               <p>The Queen in recompence of his good will returns him with this addreſſe to your Grace as a man fit for imployment, for ſo he is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reputed; but for the particularitie of the Exploit, ſhe doth not entertain any thought thereof, but refers it wholly to your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Conſideration, and to the opportunitie according as affaires ſhall ſucceed betwixt his Majeſtie, and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are come Letters from ſome of the King and Queens ſervants on that ſide, and one to my ſelf from a private friend, advertizing, That there is a readineſſe in divers of his Majeſties Subjects of good abilities, to put to Sea with Letters of Mart in the name of this Kind and Queen againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and of a likelihood, that if ſuch Commiſſions were given by theſe Princes, they would not be ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by his Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>Mounſieur <hi>Aertſens</hi> hath likewiſe written hither in a private Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that he hath been ſpoken with to move the States to increaſe the number, he and his Colleague have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of 10 or 12 Ships to joyn in any good occaſion with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Fleet to 20: And that the purpoſe is to ſet out 50 ſayl on that ſide, and that both ſhall go under the name of the King and Queen of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Wherein though the motion be not directly made, yet the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath diſcourſed enough, that when it ſhall come to iſſue, they will ſtretch themſelves to furniſh to the full what is required on this ſide. In both theſe buſineſſes, as well the granting Letters of Mart by theſe Princes, as their lending their names to any greater Action, they intend to govern themſelves onely as they ſhall underſtand to concur with his Majeſties pleaſure, and therefore hope they ſhall receive advice from his Highneſſe, and your Grace, what is fit for them to contribute to ſuch occaſions as
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:111544:197"/>they ſee much to their Comforts, you advance with ſo great care and vigilance. Thus I moſt humbly take leave,</p>

               <p>But the unſettledneſſe of this Government, which ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſince the late change of Governours, hath bred delay to ſome, and direct impediments to other points we had in charge: which we have endeavoured to ſupply by other means. And now in what ſtate he leaves the whole buſineſſe, he will relate to your Grace. Such Patents as your Grace required from the King and Queen of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> I have committed to his delivery in divers forms, with a Blank ſigned and ſealed, wherein to frame ſuch an one as may be better to your minds: But if your Grace make no uſe of it, you may pleaſe to return it to me again, to the end I may reſtore it.</p>
               <p>What concerns my ſelf, I abſolutely remit and ſubmit to your Grace; onely I will renew the requeſt I made to your Grace by my Nephew, That your Grace will not prefer any before me in your formerly intended favour, out of belief, that any can be more, then I reſolve to reſt whileſt I live <hi>a touttes Eſpreves,</hi>

               <p>AFter long attendance the wind is come good for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> which I hope will carry thither ſpeedily and ſafely the States whole Fleet, though in 3. parts; 12 Ships with the Admiral <hi>de Naſſau,</hi> who hath long waited in the <hi>Teſſel;</hi> 4 but newly ready provided by thoſe of <hi>Zealand</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and 4 which have layen ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Brill;</hi> whereof one is to land the <hi>Marſhal Chatillion</hi> in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by <hi>Calice;</hi> the other three to Convoy the Engliſh men: And Armes I ſend in 10. other Ships I have hired at <hi>Rotterdam:</hi> before which place they have layen 20 daies a Shipboard, by reaſon of contrary winds, with ſome impatiencie, but no diſorder: which what courſe I took to prevent, as likewiſe what may happen in their Voyage, my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> (to whom I give a particular account of all) will inform your Grace.</p>
               <p>I have obtained leave for Sir <hi>John Proud</hi> to go the Voyage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Majeſties Letter, though it was ſomewhat ſtood upon by the States, and he hath taken his paſſage by <hi>Zealand.</hi>

               <p>When I call to mind, what Patents I procured of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and ſent your Grace by Sir <hi>William Saint Lieger,</hi> (amongſt which was one of ſubmiſſion to any accommodation his Majeſtie ſhall at any time like well of for the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>) I think it neceſſary to advertize your Grace, that knowledge being come hither of the <hi>Infanta's</hi> ſending the Count <hi>Shomburgh</hi> to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> with a fair Meſſage, and the Count <hi>Gondomar's</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to Mr. <hi>Trumbal</hi> tending to reconcilement, and reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> it is ſo willingly hearkned unto by the King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> that there is no doubt of his Conſent: but withal he well conſiders, that if Treatie alone be truſted unto, and thereupon Armes now leavied by his Majeſtie, and his Friends be laid aſide, all will prove as fruitleſſe as formerly. For howſoever the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (for more free proſecution of other quarrels, or deſigns) may be induced to quit what he poſſeſſeth in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the ſhares, the Emperour, the Duke of <hi>Bavier,</hi> and the two Electours <hi>Majenct,</hi> and <hi>Trevers,</hi> with a great rabble of Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuites have therein, will require more then bare negotiation, to wring it out of their hands; and nothing but Victorie, or at leaſt a well armed Treatie can ſerve that turn.</p>
